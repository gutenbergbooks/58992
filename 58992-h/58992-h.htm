period, began to disintegrate. The poets had
outsung themselves; it was a time of surrender and swansongs.
Unable to respond to the new forces of political
nationalism and industrial reconstruction, the Brahmins
(that famous group of intellectuals who dominated literary
America) withdrew into their libraries. Poets like
Longfellow, Bryant, Taylor, turned their eyes away
from the native scene, rhapsodized endlessly about Europe,
echoed the “parlor poetry” of England, or left creative
writing altogether and occupied themselves with translations.
“They had been borne into an era in which they
had no part,” writes Fred Lewis Pattee (<cite>A History of
American Literature Since 1870</cite>), “and they contented
themselves with reëchoings of the old music.” ...
Within a single period of six years, from 1867 to 1872,
there appeared Longfellow’s <cite><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Divina Commedia</span></cite>, C. E.
Norton’s <cite>Vita Nuova</cite>, T. W. Parson’s <cite>Inferno</cite>, William
Cullen Bryant’s <cite>Iliad</cite> and <cite>Odyssey</cite>, and Bayard Taylor’s
<cite>Faust</cite>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Suddenly the break came. America developed a national
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xviii'>xviii</span>consciousness; the West discovered itself, and the
East discovered the West. Grudgingly at first, the aristocratic
leaders made way for a new expression; crude,
jangling, vigorously democratic. The old order was
changing with a vengeance. All the preceding writers—poets
like Emerson, Thoreau, Lowell, Longfellow,
Holmes—were not only products of the New England
colleges, but typically “Boston gentlemen of the early
Renaissance.” To them the new men must have seemed
like a regiment recruited from the ranks of vulgarity.
Walt Whitman, Mark Twain, Bret Harte, John Hay,
Joaquin Miller, Joel Chandler Harris, James Whitcomb
Riley—these were men who had graduated from the
farm, the frontier, the mine, the pilot-house, the printer’s
shop! For a while, the movement seemed of little consequence;
the impact of Whitman and the Westerners
was averted. The poets of the transition, with a deliberate
art, ignored the surge of a spontaneous national
expression. They were even successful in holding it back.
But it was gathering force.</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c011'>THE “POST-MORTEM” PERIOD</h3>

<p class='c012'>The nineteenth century, up to its last quarter, had
been a period of new vistas and revolts: a period of protest
and iconoclasm—the era of Shelley and Byron, the
prophets of “liberty, equality and fraternity.” It left
no immediate heirs. In England, its successors by default
were the lesser Victorians.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c013'><sup>[1]</sup></a> In America, the intensity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xix'>xix</span>and power of men like Emerson and Whittier gave
way to the pale romanticism and polite banter of the
transition, or, what might even more fittingly be called
the “post-mortem” poets. For these interim lyrists were
frankly the singers of reaction, reminiscently digging
among the bones of a long-dead past. They burrowed
and borrowed, half archaeologists, half artisans; impelled
not so much by the need of creating poetry as the desire
to write it.</p>

<p class='c008'>From 1866 to 1880 the United States was in a chaotic
and frankly materialistic condition; it was full of political
scandals, panics, frauds, malfeasance in high places. The
moral fiber was flabby; the country was apathetic, corrupt
and contented. As in all such periods of national
unconcern, the artists turned from life altogether, preoccupying
themselves with the by-products of art: with
method and technique, with elaborate and artificial conceits,
with facile ideas rather than fundamental ideals.
Bayard Taylor, Thomas Buchanan Read, Richard Henry
Stoddard, Paul Hamilton Hayne, Thomas Bailey Aldrich-all
of these authors, in an effort to escape a reality they
could not express and did not even wish to understand,
fled to a more congenial realm of fantasy. They took
the easiest routes to a prim and academic Arcadia, to a
cloying and devitalized Orient or a mildly sensuous and
treacle-dripping Greece. In short, they followed wherever
Keats, Shelley (in his lesser lyrics) and Tennyson
seemed to lead them. However, not being explorers
themselves, they ventured no further than their predecessors,
but remained politely in the rear; repeating dulcetly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xx'>xx</span>what they had learned from their greater guides—pronouncing
it with little variety but with a vast and sentimental
unction. In their desperate preöccupation with
lures and legends overseas, they were not, except for the
accident of birth, American at all; all of them owed much
more to old England than to New England.</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c011'>WALT WHITMAN</h3>

<p class='c012'>Whitman, who was to influence future generations so
profoundly in Europe as well as in America, had already
appeared. The third edition of that stupendous volume,
<cite>Leaves of Grass</cite>, had been printed in 1860. Almost immediately
after, the publisher failed and the book passed
out of public notice. But private scrutiny was keen. In
1865 a petty official discovered that Whitman was the
author of the “notorious” <cite>Leaves of Grass</cite> and, in spite
of his great sacrifices in nursing hundreds of wounded
soldiers, in spite of his many past services and his present
poverty, the offending poet was dismissed from his small
clerkship in the Department of the Interior at Washington,
D. C. Other reverses followed rapidly. But
Whitman, broken in health and cheated by his exploiters,
lived to see not only a seventh edition of his great work
published in 1881, but a complete collection printed in
his seventy-third year (1892) in which the twelve poems
of the experimental first edition had grown to nearly
four hundred.</p>

<p class='c008'>The influence of Whitman can scarcely be overestimated.
It has touched every shore of letters, quickened
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxi'>xxi</span>every current of art. And yet, as late as 1900,
Barrett Wendell in his <cite>Literary History of America</cite> could
speak of Whitman’s “eccentric insolence of phrase and
temper” and, perturbed by the poet’s increasing vogue
across the Atlantic (Whitman had been hailed by men
as eminent as Swinburne, Symonds, Rossetti), he is led
to write such a preposterous sentence as “In temperament
and style he was an exotic member of that sterile
brotherhood which eagerly greeted him abroad.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Such a judgment would be impossible today. Whitman
has been acclaimed by a great and growing public,
not only here but in England, Germany, Italy and
France. He has been hailed as prophet, as pioneer, as
rebel, as the fiery humanist and, most frequently, as
liberator. He is, in spite of the rhetorical flourish, the
Lincoln of our literature. The whole scheme of <cite>Leaves
of Grass</cite> is inclusive rather than exclusive; its form is
elemental, dynamic, free.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nor was it only in the relatively minor matter of form
that Whitman became our great poetic emancipator. He
led the way toward a wider aspect of democracy; he took
his readers out of fusty, lamp-lit libraries into the coarse
sunlight and the buoyant air. He was, as Burroughs
wrote, preëminently the poet of vista; his work had the
power “to open doors and windows, to let down bars
rather than to put them up, to dissolve forms, to escape
narrow boundaries, to plant the reader on a hill rather
than in a corner.” He could do this because, first of all,
he believed implicitly in life—in its physical as well as
its spiritual manifestations; he sought to grasp existence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxii'>xxii</span>as a whole, not rejecting the things that, to other minds,
had seemed trivial or tawdry. The cosmic and the commonplace
were synonymous to him; he declared he was
part of the most elemental, primitive things and constantly
identified himself with them.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c003'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='small'><i>“What is commonest, cheapest, nearest, easiest is Me.”</i></span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>And by “me” he meant not only himself but any man;
Whitman’s entire work, which has so often been misunderstood
as the outpourings of egotism, was never so
much a celebration of himself as a glorification of the
ordinary man, “the divine average.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It was this breadth, this jubilant acceptance that made
Whitman so keen a lover of casual and ordinary things;
he was the first of our poets to reveal “the glory of the
commonplace.” He transmuted, by the intensity of his
emotion, material which had been hitherto regarded as
too unpoetic for poetry. His long poem “Song of Myself”
is an excellent example. Here his “barbaric
yawp,” sounded “over the roofs of the world,” is
softened, time and again, to express a lyric ecstasy and
naïf wonder.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c003'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

      <div class='line'><span class='small'>I believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journey-work of the stars,</span></div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xxiii'>xxiii</span>It is this large naturalism, this affection for all that
is homely and of the soil, that sets Whitman apart from
his fellow-craftsmen as our first American poet. This
blend of familiarity and grandeur, this racy but religious
mysticism animates all his work. It swings with tremendous
vigor through “Crossing Brooklyn Ferry”; it
sharpens the sturdy rhythms (and occasional rhymes) of
the “Song of the Broad-Axe”; it beats sonorously
through “Drum-Taps”; it whispers immortally through
the “Memories of President Lincoln” (particularly that
magnificent threnody “When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard
Bloomed”); it quickens the “Song of the Open
Road” with what Tennyson called “the glory of going
on,” and lifts with a biblical solemnity in his most famous
“Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Whitman did not scorn the past; no one was quicker
than he to see its wealth and glories. But most of the
older flowerings belonged to their own era; they were
foreign to our country—transplanted, they did not seem
to flourish on this soil. What was original with many
transatlantic poets was being merely aped by facile and
unoriginal bards in these states; concerned only with the
myths of other and older countries, they were blind to
the living legends of their own. In his “Song of the
Exposition” Whitman not only wrote his own <i>credo</i>, he
uttered the manifesto of the new generation—especially
in these lines:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c003'>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c011'>THE AWAKENING OF THE WEST</h3>

<p class='c012'>By 1870 the public had been surfeited with sugared
conceits and fine-spun delicacies. For almost twelve
years, Whitman had stormed at the affectations and over-refinements
of the period but comparatively few had
listened. Yet an instinctive distaste for the prevailing
superficialities had been growing, and when the West
began to express itself in the raw accents of Mark Twain
and Bret Harte, the people turned to them with enthusiasm
and no little relief. Mark Twain, a prose
Whitman, revealed the romantic Mississippi and the vast
mid-West; Bret Harte, beginning a new American
fiction in 1868, ushered in the wild humor and wilder
poetry of California. It is still a question whether Bret
Harte or John Hay first discovered the literary importance
of Pike County narratives. Twain was positive
that Hay was the pioneer; documentary evidence points
to Harte. But it is indisputable that Harte developed—and
even overdeveloped—the possibilities of his backgrounds,
whereas Hay after a few brilliant ballads, reverted
to his early poetic ideals and turned to the production
of studied, polished and undistinguished verse.
Lacking the tremendous gusto of Mark Twain or even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxv'>xxv</span>the native accuracy of Hay, Bret Harte perfected a
terse, dramatic idiom. Less exuberant than his compeers,
he became more skilful in making his situations
“effective”; he popularized dialect, sharpening his outlines
and intensifying the power of his prose. Harte’s
was an influence that found its echo in the Hoosier stories
of Edward Eggleston and made so vivid an impress on
nineteenth century literature.</p>

<p class='c008'>To the loose swagger of the West, two other men
added their diverse contributions. Edward Rowland
Sill, cut short just as his work was gaining headway and
strength, brought to it a gentle radicalism, a calm and
cultured honesty; Joaquin Miller, rushing to the other
extreme, theatricalized and exaggerated all he touched.
He shouted platitudes at the top of his voice; his lines
boomed with the pomposity of a brass band; floods, fires,
hurricanes, extravagantly blazing sunsets, Amazonian
women, the thunder of a herd of buffaloes—all were unmercifully
piled on. And yet, even in its most blatant
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">fortissimos</span></i>, Miller’s poetry occasionally captured the
lavish grandeur of his surroundings, the splendor of the
Sierras, the surge and spirit of the Western world.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now that the leadership of letters had passed from
the East, all parts of the country began to try their
voices. The West continued to hold its tuneful supremacy;
the tradition of Harte and Hay was followed
(softened and sentimentalized) by Eugene Field and
James Whitcomb Riley. In the South, Irwin Russell
was pioneering in negro dialect (1875), Sidney Lanier
fashioned his intricate harmonies (1879), and Madison
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxvi'>xxvi</span>Cawein was beginning to create his tropical and over-luxuriant
lyrics. A few years later (in 1888) Russell
brought out his faithfully-rendered <cite>Dialect Poems</cite> and
the first phase of the American renascence had passed.</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c011'>REACTION AND REVOLT IN THE ’90S</h3>

<p class='c012'>The reaction set in at the beginning of the last decade
of the nineteenth century. The passionate urge had
spent itself, and in its place there remained nothing but
that minor form of art which concerns itself less with
creation than with re-creation. These re-creators wrote
verse that was precise, scholarly and patently reproductive
of their predecessors. “In 1890,” writes Percy H.
Boynton, “the poetry-reading world was chiefly conscious
of the passing of its leading singers for the last
half-century. It was a period when they were recalling
Emerson’s ‘Terminus’ and Longfellow’s ‘Ultima
Thule,’ Whittier’s ‘A Lifetime,’ Tennyson’s ‘Crossing
the Bar,’ and Browning’s ‘Asolando.’”&nbsp;... The poetry
of this period (whether it is the hard chiseled verse of
John B. Tabb or the ornate delicacy of Richard Watson
Gilder) breathes a kind of moribund resignation; it is
dead because it detached itself from the actual world,
because it attempted to be a copied embellishment rather
than an interpretation of life. But those who regarded
poetry chiefly as a not too energetic indoor-exercise were
not to rule unchallenged. Restlessness was in the air
and revolt openly declared itself with the publication of
<cite>Songs from Vagabondia</cite> (1894), <cite>More Songs from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxvii'>xxvii</span>Vagabondia</cite> (1896) and <cite>Last Songs from Vagabondia</cite>
(1900). No one could have been more surprised at
the tremendous popularity of these care-free celebrations
(the first of the three collections went through seven
rapid editions) than the young authors, Richard Hovey
and Bliss Carman. For theirs was a revolt without a
program, a headlong flight to escape—what? In the
very first poem, Hovey voices their manifesto:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c003'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='small'>Off with the fetters</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span class='small'>That chafe and restrain!</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span class='small'>Off with the chain!</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span class='small'>Here Art and Letters,</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span class='small'>Music and Wine</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span class='small'>And Myrtle and Wanda,</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span class='small'>The winsome witches,</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span class='small'>Blithely combine.</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span class='small'>Here is Golconda,</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span class='small'>Here are the Indies,</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span class='small'>Here we are free—</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span class='small'>Free as the wind is,</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span class='small'>Free as the sea,</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span class='small'>Free!</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Free for what? one asks doggedly. Hovey does not
answer directly, but with unflagging buoyancy, whipped
up by scorn for the smug ones, he continues:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c003'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='small'>I tell you that we,</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span class='small'>While you are smirking</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span class='small'>And lying and shirking</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span class='small'>Life’s duty of duties,</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span class='small'>Honest sincerity,</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span class='small'>We are in verity</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span class='small'>Free!</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span class='small'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xxviii'>xxviii</span>Free to rejoice</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span class='small'>In blisses and beauties!</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span class='small'>Free as the voice</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span class='small'>Of the wind as it passes!</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span class='small'>Free ... <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">etc.</span></i></span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Free, one concludes, to dwell with Music and Wine,
Myrtle and Wanda, Art and Letters. Free, in short,
to follow, with a more athletic energy, the same ideals
as the parlor-poets they gibed so relentlessly. And the
new insurgence triumphed. It was the heartiness, the
gypsy jollity, the rush of high spirits that conquered.
Readers of the <cite>Vagabondia</cite> books were swept along by
their speed faster than by their philosophy.</p>

<p class='c008'>The enthusiastic acceptance of these new apostles of
outdoor vigor was, however, not as much of an accident
as it seemed. On one side, the world of art, the public
was wearied by barren philosophizing set to tinkling
music; on the other, the world of action, it was faced
by a staggering growth of materialism which it feared.
Hovey, Carman and their imitators offered a swift and
stirring way out. But it was neither an effectual nor
a permanent escape. The war with Spain, the industrial
turmoil, the growth of social consciousness and new ideas
of responsibility made America look for fresh valuations,
more searching songs. Hovey began to go deeper into
himself and his age; in the mid-West, William Vaughn
Moody grappled with the problems of his times only to
have his work cut short by death in 1910. But these two
were exceptions; in the main, it was another interval—two
decades of appraisal and expectancy, of pause and
preparation.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_xxix'>xxix</span>
  <div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c011'>INTERIM—1890–1912</h3>
</div>

<p class='c012'>This interval of about twenty years was notable for
its effort to treat the spirit of the times with a cheerful
evasiveness, a humorous unconcern; its most representative
craftsmen were, with four exceptions, the writers
of light verse. These four exceptions were Richard
Hovey, Bliss Carman, William Vaughn Moody and Edwin
Markham. Both Hovey (in his <cite>Along the Trail</cite>
and his modernization of <cite>Launcelot</cite> and <cite>Guenevere</cite>, a
poetic drama in five books) and Carman (in his later
poems like <cite>Songs of the Sea Children</cite>) saw wider horizons
and tuned their instruments to a larger music.</p>

<p class='c008'>Moody’s power was still greater. In “An Ode in
Time of Hesitation,” he protested against turning the
“new-world victories into gain” and painted America
on a majestic canvas. In “The Quarry” he celebrated
America’s part in preventing the breaking-up of China
by the greedy empires of Europe (an act accomplished
by John Hay, poet and diplomat). In “On a Soldier
Fallen in the Philippines,” a dirge wrenched from the
depths of his nature, Moody cried out against our own
grasping imperialists. It was the fulfilment of this earlier
poem which found its fierce climax in the lengthy Ode,
with lines like:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c003'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='small'>Was it for this our fathers kept the law?</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span class='small'>This crown shall crown their struggle and their ruth?</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span class='small'>Are we the eagle nation Milton saw</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span class='small'>Mewing its mighty youth?...</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span class='small'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xxx'>xxx</span>... O ye who lead</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span class='small'>Take heed!</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span class='small'>Blindness we may forgive, but baseness we will smite.</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Early in 1899, the name of Edwin Markham flashed
across the land when, out of San Francisco, rose the
sonorous challenge of “The Man with the Hoe.” This
poem, which has been ecstatically called “the battle-cry
of the next thousand years” (Joaquin Miller declared it
contained “the whole Yosemite—the thunder, the might,
the majesty”), caught up, with a prophetic vibrancy, the
passion for social justice that was waiting to be intensified
in poetry. Markham summed up and spiritualized
the unrest that was in the air; in the figure of one man
with a hoe, he drew a picture of men in the mines, men
in the sweat-shop, men working without joy, without
hope. To social consciousness he added social conscience.
In a ringing blank verse, Markham crystallized the expression
of outrage, the heated ferment of the period. His
was a vision of a new order, austere in beauty but deriving
its life-blood from the millions struggling in the
depths.</p>

<p class='c008'>Inspiring as these examples were, they did not generate
others of their kind; the field lay fallow for more than
a decade. The lull was pronounced, the gathering storm
remained inaudible.</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c011'>RENASCENCE—1913</h3>

<p class='c012'>Suddenly the “new” poetry burst upon us with unexpected
vigor and extraordinary variety. Moody and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxi'>xxxi</span>Markham were its immediate forerunners; Whitman its
godfather. October, 1912, saw the first issue of <cite>Poetry:
A Magazine of Verse</cite>, a monthly that was to introduce
the work of hitherto unknown poets and to herald, with
an eager impartiality, the various groups, schools and
“movements.” The magazine came at the very moment
before the breaking of the storm. Flashes and rumblings
had already been troubling the literary heavens; a few
months later—the deluge! For three years the skies
continued to discharge such strange and divergent phenomena
as Vachel Lindsay’s <cite>General William Booth
Enters into Heaven</cite> (1913), James Oppenheim’s <cite>Songs
for the New Age</cite> (1914), the first anthology of <cite>The
Imagists</cite> (1914), <cite>Challenge</cite> (1914), Amy Lowell’s
<cite>Sword Blades and Poppy Seed</cite> (1914), Lindsay’s <cite>The
Congo and Other Poems</cite> (1914), Robert Frost’s <cite>North
of Boston</cite> (1914), Edgar Lee Master’s <cite>Spoon River
Anthology</cite> (1915), John Gould Fletcher’s <cite>Irradiations</cite>
(1915), Carl Sandburg’s <cite>Chicago Poems</cite> (1916). By
1917, the “new” poetry was ranked as “America’s first
national art”; its success was sweeping, its sales unprecedented.
People who never before had read verse,
turned to it and found they could not only read but
relish it. They discovered that for the enjoyment of
poetry it was not necessary to have at their elbows a dictionary
of rare words and classical references; they no
longer were required to be acquainted with Latin
legendry and the minor love-affairs of the major Greek
divinities. Life was their glossary, not literature. The
new product spoke to them in their own language. And
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxii'>xxxii</span>it did more: it spoke to them of what they had scarcely
ever heard expressed; it was not only closer to their soil
but nearer their souls.</p>

<p class='c012'>One reason why the new poetry achieved so sudden a
success was its freedom from the traditionally stilted
“poetic diction.” Revolting strongly against the assumption
that poetry must have a vocabulary of its own, the
poets of the new era spoke in the oldest and most stirring
tongue; they used a language that was the language not
of the poetasters but of the people. In the tones of ordinary
speech they rediscovered the strength, the dignity,
the divine core of the commonplace.</p>

<p class='c008'>E. A. Robinson had already been employing the sharp
epithet, the direct and clarifying utterance which was to
become part of our present technique. As early as 1897,
in <cite>The Children of the Night</cite>, Robinson anticipated the
brief characterizations and the etched outlines of Masters’s
<cite>Spoon River Anthology</cite>; he stressed the psychological
element with unerring artistry and sureness of
touch. His sympathetic studies of men whose lives were,
from a worldly standpoint, failures were a sharp reaction
to the current high valuation on financial achievements,
ruthless efficiency and success at any cost. Ahead
of his period, he had to wait until 1916, when a public
prepared for him by the awakened interest in native
poetry discovered <cite>The Man Against the Sky</cite> (1916) and
the richness of Robinson at the same time.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxiii'>xxxiii</span>Frost and Masters were the bright particular planets
of 1915, although the star of the latter has waned while
the light of the former has grown in magnitude. Yet
Masters’s most famous book will rank as one of the landmarks
of American literature. In it, he has synthesized
the small towns of the mid-West with a background that
is unmistakably local and implications that are universal.
This amazing volume, in its curiosity and comprehensiveness,
is a broad cross-section of whole communities. Beneath
its surface tales and dramas, its condensation of
grocery store gossip, <cite>Spoon River Anthology</cite> is a great
part of America in microcosm. The success of the
volume was sensational. It was actually one of the season’s
“best sellers”; in a few months, it went into edition
after edition. People forgot Masters’s revelation of
the sordid cheats and hypocrisies, his arraignment of dirty
politics and dirtier chicanery, in their interest at seeing
their neighbors so pitilessly exposed. Yet had Masters
dwelt only on the drab disillusion of the village, had he
(as he was constantly in danger of doing) overemphasized
the morbid and sensual episodes, he would have left only
a spectacular and poorly-balanced work. But the book
ascends to buoyant exaltation and ends on a plane of victorious
idealism. In its wide gamut, <cite>Spoon River</cite>, rising
from its narrow origins, reaches epical proportions. Indigenous
to its roots, it is stark, unflinching, unforgettable.</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c011'>FROST AND SANDBURG</h3>

<p class='c012'>The same year that brought forth <cite>Spoon River Anthology</cite>
saw the American edition of Frost’s <cite>North of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxiv'>xxxiv</span>Boston</cite>. It was evident at once that the true poet of
New England had arrived. Unlike his predecessors, Frost
was never a poetic provincial—never parochial in the sense
that America was still a literary parish of England. He
is as native as the lonely farmhouses, the dusty blueberries,
the isolated people, the dried-up brooks and mountain
intervals that he describes. Loving, above everything
else, the beauty of the Fact, he shares, with Robinson and
Masters, the determination to tell not merely the actual
but the factual truth. But Frost, a less disillusioned though
a more saddened poet, wears his rue and his realism with
a difference. Where Robinson is downright and definite,
Frost diverges, going roundabout and, in his speculative
wandering, covering a wider territory of thought. Where
Masters is violent and hotly scornful, Frost is reticent
and quietly sympathetic. Again where Masters, viewing
the mêlée above the struggle, writes <i>about</i> his characters,
Frost is <i>of</i> the people. Where Robinson, in his more
racy and reminiscent moods, often reflects New England,
Frost <i>is</i> New England.</p>

<p class='c008'><cite>North of Boston</cite> is well described by the poet’s own
subtitle: “a book of people.” In it one not only sees
a countryside of people making the intricate pattern of
their lives, one catches them thinking out loud, one can
hear the very tones of their voices. Here we have speech
so arranged and translated that the speaker is heard on
the printed page; any reader will be led by the kind and
color of these words into reproducing the changing accents
in which they are supposed to be uttered. It is
this insistence that “all poetry is the reproduction of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxv'>xxxv</span>tones of actual speech” that gives these poems, as well as
the later ones, a quickly-communicated emotional appeal. It
endows them with the deepest power of which words are
capable—the power to transmit significant sounds. These
sounds, let in from the vernacular, are full of a robust,
creative energy; they share the blood and bones of the
people they represent.</p>

<p class='c008'>But Frost is by no means the dark naturalist that many
suspect. Behind the mask of “grimness” which many
of his critics have fastened upon him, there is a continual
elfin pucker; a whimsical smile, a half-disclosed raillery
glints beneath his most somber monologues. His most
concrete facts are symbols of spiritual values; through his
very reticence one hears more than the voice of New
England.</p>

<p class='c008'>Just so, the great mid-West, that vast region of steel
mills and slaughter-houses, of cornfields and prairies, of
crowded cities and empty skies, speaks through Carl
Sandburg. In Sandburg, industrial America has found
its voice: <cite>Chicago Poems</cite> (1916), <cite>Cornhuskers</cite> (1918),
<cite>Smoke and Steel</cite> (1920) vibrate with the immense purring
of dynamos, the swishing rhythms of threshing arms, the
gossip and laughter of construction gangs, the gigantic
and tireless energy of the modern machine. Frankly
indebted to Whitman, Sandburg’s poems are less sweeping
but more varied; musically his lines mark a great advance.
He sounds the extremes of the gamut: there are
few poems in our language more violent than “To a
Contemporary Bunkshooter,” few lyrics as hushed and
tender as “Cool Tombs.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxvi'>xxxvi</span>Like Frost, Sandburg is true to <i>things</i>. But Frost is
content with the inexhaustible Fact and its spiritual implications;
he never hopes to drain it all. Sandburg also
feeds on the fact, but it does not satisfy him. He has
strange hungers; he hunts eagerly for the question behind,
the answer beyond. The actual scene, to him, is a point
of vivid and abrupt departure. Reality, far from being
the earth on which he dwells, is, for Sandburg, the ground
he touches before rising; realism acts merely as a springboard
from which this poet leaps into a romantic
mysticism.</p>

<p class='c008'>When <cite>Chicago Poems</cite> first appeared, it was received
with a disfavor ranging from hesitant patronization to
the scornful jeers of the academicians. Sandburg was
accused of verbal anarchy; of a failure to distinguish
prose matter from poetic material; of uncouthness, vulgarity,
of assaults on the English language and a score
of other crimes. In the face of those who still see only
a coarseness and distorted veritism in Sandburg, it cannot
be said too often that he is brutal only when dealing
with brutal things; that his “vulgarity” springs from
an immense love of life, not from a merely decorative
part of it; that his bitterest invectives are the result of
a healthy disgust of shams; that, behind the force of his
projectile-phrases, there burns the greater flame of his
pity; that the strength of his hatred is exceeded only by
the challenge of his love.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxvii'>xxxvii</span>
  <div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c011'>THE IMAGISTS</h3>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Sandburg established himself as the most daring user
of American words—rude words ranging from the racy
metaphors of the soil to the slang of the street. But even
before this, the possibilities of a new vocabulary were
being tested. As early as 1865, Whitman was saying,
“We must have new words, new potentialities of
speech—an American range of self-expression ... The
new times, the new people need a tongue according, yes,
and what is more, they will have such a tongue—will
not be satisfied until it is evolved.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It is curious to think that one of the most effective
agents to fulfil Whitman’s prophecy and free modern
poetry from its mouldering diction was that little band
of preoccupied specialists, the Imagists. They were, for
all their preciosity and occasional extravagances, prophets
of freedom—liberators in the sense that their programs,
pronouncements and propaganda compelled even their
most dogged adversaries to acknowledge the integrity of
their aims. Their restatement of old truths was one of
the things which helped the new poetry out of a bog
of rhetorical rubbish.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ezra Pound was the first to gather the insurgents into
a definite group. During the winter of 1913, he collected
a number of poems illustrating the Imagist point of view
and had them printed in a volume: <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Des Imagistes</span></cite> (1914).
A little later Pound withdrew from the clan. The rather
queerly assorted group began to disintegrate and Amy
Lowell, then in England, brought the best of the younger
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxviii'>xxxviii</span>members together in three yearly anthologies (<cite>Some Imagist
Poets</cite>) which appeared in 1915, 1916 and 1917.
There were, in Miss Lowell’s new grouping, three Englishmen
(D. H. Lawrence, Richard Aldington, F. S.
Flint), three Americans (“H. D.,” John Gould
Fletcher, Amy Lowell), and their creed, summed up in
six articles of faith, was as follows:</p>

<p class='c014'>1. To use the language of common speech, but to employ
always the <i>exact</i> word, not the merely decorative word.</p>

<p class='c015'>2. To create new rhythms—as the expression of new moods.
We do not insist upon “free-verse” as the only method of
writing poetry ... We do believe that the individuality of
a poet may often be better expressed in free verse than in
conventional forms.</p>

<p class='c015'>3. To allow absolute freedom in the choice of subject.</p>

<p class='c015'>4. To present an image (hence the name: “Imagist”). We
are not a school of painters, but we believe that poetry should
render particulars exactly and not deal in vague generalities,
however magnificent and sonorous.</p>

<p class='c015'>5. To produce poetry that is hard and clear, never blurred
or indefinite.</p>

<p class='c015'>6. Finally, most of us believe that concentration is the very
essence of poetry.</p>

<p class='c012'>It does not seem possible that these six obvious and
almost platitudinous principles, which the Imagists so
often neglected in their poetry, could have evoked the
storm of argument, fury and downright vilification that
broke as soon as the militant Amy Lowell began to
champion them. Far from being revolutionary, these
principles were not new; they were not even thought so
by their sponsors. The Imagists themselves realized they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxix'>xxxix</span>were merely restating ideals which had fallen into
desuetude, and declared, “They are the essentials of all
great poetry, indeed of all great literature.” And yet
many conservative critics, joined by the one hundred per
cent reactionaries, rushed wildly to combat these “heresies”!
They forgot that, in trying to protect the
future from such lawlessness as “using the exact word,”
from allowing “freedom in the choice of subject,” from
the importance of “concentration,” they were actually
attacking the highest traditions of their enshrined past.</p>

<p class='c008'>The controversy succeeded in doing even more than
the work of the Imagists themselves. “H. D.” remained
in England, perfecting her delicate and exquisitely finished
designs. John Gould Fletcher, a more vacillating
expatriate, continued to strengthen his gift and shift his
standards; his later and richer work is in almost flat
opposition to the early pronouncements. Miss Lowell
was left to carry on the battle single-handed; to defend
the theories which, in practice, she was beginning to violate
brilliantly. By all odds, the most energetic and unflagging
experimenter, Miss Lowell’s versatility became amazing.
She has wielded a controversial cudgel with one hand
and, with the other, she has written Chaucerian stanzas,
polyphonic prose, monologs in her native New England
dialect, irregular <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vers libre</span></i>, conservative couplets, translations
from the French, echoes from the Japanese, even
primitive re-creations of Indian folk-lore!</p>

<p class='c008'>The work of the Imagists was done. Its members
began to develop themselves by themselves. They had
helped to swell the tide of realistic and romantic naturalism—a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xl'>xl</span>tide of which their contribution was merely
one wave, a high breaker that carried its impact far
inshore.</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c011'>THE NEW FOLK-POETRY</h3>

<p class='c012'>In a country that has not been mellowed by antiquity,
that has not possessed songs for its peasantry or traditions
for its singers, one cannot look for a wealth of folk-stuff.
In such a country—the United States, to be
specific—what folk-poetry there is, has followed the path
of the pioneer. At first these homely songs were merely
adaptations and localized versions of English ballads and
border minstrelsy, of which the “Lonesome Tunes” discovered
in the Kentucky mountains by Howard Brockway
and Loraine Wyman are excellent examples. But later,
a more definitely native spirit found expression in the
various sections of these states. In the West (during the
seventies) Bret Harte and John Hay celebrated, in their
own accents, the rough, big-hearted miners, ranchers,
steamboat pilots, the supposed descendants of the emigrants
from Pike County, Missouri. In the Middle West
the desire for local color and music led to the popularity
of James Whitcomb Riley’s Hoosier ballads and the
spirited jingles of Eugene Field. In the South the inspiration
of the negro spirituals and ante-bellum songs
was utilized to excellent effect by Irwin Russell, Joel
Chandler Harris and, later, by Paul Laurence Dunbar.
The Indian, a more genuine primitive, has been as difficult
to transplant poetically as he has been to assimilate
ethnically. But, in spite of the racial differences in sentiment,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xli'>xli</span>religion and philosophy, brave attempts to bring
the spirit of the Indian originals into our poetry have
been made by Mary Austin, Constance Lindsay Skinner,
Natalie Curtis Burlin, Lew Sarett and Alice Corbin
Henderson.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the West today there is a revival of interest in
backwoods melodies and folk-created verse. John A.
Lomax has published two volumes of cowboy songs—most
of them anonymous—full of tang, wild fancy and
robust humor. The tradition of Harte and Hay is being
carried on by such racy interpreters as Harry Herbert
Knibbs, Badger Clark and Edwin Ford Piper. But, of
all contemporaries who approximate the spirit of folk-poetry,
none has made more striking or more indubitably
American contributions than Vachel Lindsay of Springfield,
Illinois.</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c011'>LINDSAY, OPPENHEIM AND OTHERS</h3>

<p class='c012'>Lindsay is essentially a people’s poet. He does not
hesitate to express himself in terms of the lowest common
denominator; his fingers are alternately on his pen
and the public pulse. Living near enough the South to
appreciate the negro and yet not too near to despise
him, Lindsay has been tremendously influenced by the
colorful suggestions, the fantastic superstitions, the revivalistic
gusto, the half-savage Christianity and, above
all, by the curiously syncopated music that characterize
the black man in America. In “The Congo,” “John
Brown” and the less extended but equally remarkable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xlii'>xlii</span>“Simon Legree,” the words roll with the solemnity of
an exhortation, dance with a grotesque fervor or snap,
crackle, wink and leap with all the humorous rhythms
of a piece of “ragtime.” Lindsay catches the burly
color and boisterous music of camp-meetings, minstrel
shows, revival jubilees.</p>

<p class='c008'>And Lindsay does more. He carries his democratic
determinations further than any of his <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">confrères</span></i>. His
dream is of a great communal Art; he preaches the
gospel that all villages should be centers of beauty, all its
citizens, artists. At heart a missionary even more than
a minstrel, Lindsay often loses himself in his own
evangelism; worse, he frequently cheapens himself and
caricatures his own gift by pandering to the vaudeville
instinct that insists on putting a noisy “punch” into
everything, regardless of taste, artistry or a sense of proportion.
He is most impressive when he is least frenetic,
when he is purely fantastic (as in “The Chinese Nightingale”
or the series of metaphorical poems about the
moon) or when a greater theme and a finer restraint
unite (as in “The Eagle That Is Forgotten”) to create
a preaching that does not cease to be poetry.</p>

<p class='c008'>Something of the same blend of prophet and poet is
found in the work of James Oppenheim. Oppenheim is
a throwback to the ancient Hebrew singers; the music of
the Psalms rolls through his lines, the fire of Isaiah
kindles his spirit. This poetry, with its obvious reminders
of Whitman, is biblical in its inflection, Oriental
in its heat; it runs through forgotten centuries
and brings buried Asia to busy America. It carries to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xliii'>xliii</span>the Western world the color of the East, adding the
gift of prophecy to pragmatic purpose. In books like
<cite>War and Laughter</cite> and <cite>Songs for the New Age</cite> the
race of god-breakers and god-makers speaks with a new
voice; here, with analytic intensity, the old iconoclasm
and still older worship are again united.</p>

<hr class='c016' />

<p class='c008'>The new poets have won their way by their differences
as well as by their chance similarities. They belong to
no one school, represent no single tendency and, differing
widely from their present-day English fellow-craftsmen,
are far less hampered by the burdens of traditions or the
necessity of casting them off. They are more nearly free.
One sees this even in the work of the more deliberately
conventional singers. Lyricists like Sara Teasdale and
Edna St. Vincent Millay write in a clean, straightforward
idiom, an intense naturalness that is a frank commentary
on the tinkling and over-sentimental verse that used to
pass for genuine emotion. Robert Frost and E. A. Robinson
continue to use the strictest rhymes and most rigid
meters and yet their lines are as “modern,” as searching
as the freest free verse. Form <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per se</span></i> matters scarcely at
all; all forms are employed. Conrad Aiken achieves a
flexible combination of rhyme and assonance. Sandburg,
“H. D.,” Kreymborg and John Gould Fletcher dispense,
for the most part, with rhyme, without sacrificing the
beauty of sound or stress. Masters and Amy Lowell
use the old forms and the new ones with impartiality
and equal skill. A sweeping inclusiveness distinguishes
our contemporary verse; it embraces all themes, all cultures,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xliv'>xliv</span>all modes of expression. America has become a
melting-pot in a poetic as well as an ethnic sense. The
rich variety of its structure and subject-matter is in
striking opposition to the thin, specialized product of the
transition poets. New England is no longer the single
literary center. As the country has matured, the poets
have grown with it, singing everywhere and, much to
Art’s confusion, in every key. It is as if submerged
springs had burst through stubborn ground; instead of
one placid stream, there are a dozen rushing currents.</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c011'>SUMMARY—THE NEW SPIRIT</h3>

<p class='c012'>It is difficult to draw a line between periods, especially
when one is called upon to define “modernity.” But
in the case of the development of American poetry, the
task is made easier by Whitman. Whitman ended and
began an epoch. This collection therefore begins where
he left off; it might well be called, “American Poetry
Since Whitman.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It would have been pleasant to divide the poetry
itself into groups and distinct tendencies. Unfortunately
such a scheme is impossible. In the first place, one can
scarcely get a proper perspective on contemporary writers
(on whom the chief emphasis has been placed), especially
since many of them are still developing. Secondly, one
cannot give the picture of a period in the state of
flux except by showing its fluid character. The prime
object of this collection is to reflect this very flux and
diversity—particularly illustrated by those poets who, because
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xlv'>xlv</span>of their strong individualism, would not fit in any
one grouping. Since the chronological arrangement is,
therefore, the most logical one, an arbitrary boundary has
been fixed. The year 1830 becomes the dividing-line;
any poet born earlier than that date is ruthlessly excluded.
This, fortunately, eliminates scarcely any poet of value;
for between Whitman (born 1819) and Emily Dickinson
(that early imagist), there were no singers more
memorable than the Cary sisters, Bayard Taylor and the
painfully precise Richard Henry Stoddard.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is a happy circumstance that this volume should
begin with Emily Dickinson, whose work, posthumously
printed, was unknown as late as 1890 and scarcely
noticed until several years later. For here is a forerunner
of the new spirit—free in expression, unhampered
in choice of subject, penetrative in psychology—to
which a countryful of writers has responded. No longer
confined to one or two literary centers, the impulse to
create is everywhere. There is scarcely a state, barely a
township, that has not produced its laureate.</p>

<p class='c008'>Most of the poets represented in these pages have found
a fresh and vigorous material in a world of honest and
often harsh reality. They respond to the spirit of their
times; not only have their views changed, their vision
has been widened to include things unknown to the poet
of yesterday. They have learned to distinguish real
beauty from mere prettiness; to wring loveliness out of
squalor; to find wonder in neglected places; to search
for hidden truths even in the dark caves of the unconscious.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xlvi'>xlvi</span>And with the use of the material of everyday life,
there has come a further simplification: the use of the
language of everyday speech. The stilted and mouth-filling
phrases have been practically discarded in favor
of words that are part of our daily vocabulary. It would
be hard at present to find a representative poet employing
such awkward and outworn contractions as <i>’twixt</i>,
<i>’mongst</i>, <i>ope’</i>; such evidences of poor padding as <i>adown</i>,
<i>did go</i>, <i>doth smile</i>; such dull rubber-stamps (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">clichés</span></i> is
the French term) as <i>heavenly blue</i>, <i>roseate glow</i>, <i>golden
hope</i>, <i>girlish grace</i>, <i>gentle breeze</i>, etc. The <i>peradventures</i>,
<i>forsooths</i> and <i>mayhaps</i> have disappeared....
And, as the speech of the modern poet has grown less
elaborate, so have the patterns that embody it. Not
necessarily discarding rhyme, regular rhythm or any of
the musical assets of the older poets, the forms have
grown simpler; the intricate versification has given way
to lines that reflect and suggest the tones of animated
and even exalted speech. The result of this has been
a great gain both in sincerity and intensity; it has enabled
the poet of today to put greater emphasis on his emotion
rather than on the shell that covers it—he can dwell with
richer detail on the matter instead of the manner.</p>

<p class='c008'>One could go into minute particulars concerning the
growth of an American spirit in our literature and point
out how many of the latter-day poets have responded to
native forces larger than their backgrounds. Such a
course would be endless and unprofitable. It is pertinent,
however, to observe that, young as this nation is, it is
already being supplied with the stuff of legends, ballads
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xlvii'>xlvii</span>and even epics. The modern singer has turned to celebrate
his own folk-tales. It is particularly interesting to
observe how the figure of Lincoln has been treated by
the best of our living poets. I have accordingly included
seven poems by seven writers, each differing in manner,
technique and point of view.</p>

<p class='c008'>For the rest, I leave the casual reader, as well as the
student, to discover the awakened vigor and energy in
this, one of the few great poetic periods in native literature.
With the realization that this brief gathering is
not so much a summary as an introduction, it is hoped
that, in spite of its limitations, this collection will draw
the reader on to a closer consideration of the poets here
included—even to those omitted. The purpose of such
an anthology must always be to stimulate an interest
rather than to satisfy a curiosity. Such, at least, is the
hope and aim of one editor.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>
  <h2 class='c005'><i>Emily Dickinson</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Emily Dickinson, whose work is one of the most original
contributions to recent poetry, was born in Amherst, Massachusetts,
December 10, 1830. She was a physical as well as a
spiritual hermit, actually spending most of her life without
setting foot beyond her doorstep. She wrote her short, introspective
verses without thought of publication, and it was not
until 1890, four years after her death, that the first volume
of her posthumous poetry appeared with an introduction by
Thomas Wentworth Higginson.</p>

<p class='c015'>“She habitually concealed her mind, like her person, from
all but a very few friends,” writes Higginson, “and it was
with great difficulty that she was persuaded to print, during her
lifetime, three or four poems.” Yet she wrote almost five hundred
of these direct and spontaneous illuminations, sending
many of them in letters to friends, or (written on chance slips
of paper and delivered without further comment) to her sister
Sue. Slowly the peculiar Blake-like quality of her thought
won a widening circle of readers; <cite>Poems</cite> (1890) was followed
by <cite>Poems—Second Series</cite> (1892) and <cite>Poems—Third Series</cite>
(1896), the contents being collected and edited by her two
friends, Thomas Wentworth Higginson and Mabel Loomis Todd.
Several years later, a further generous volume was assembled
by her niece, Martha Dickinson Bianchi, entitled <cite>The Single
Hound</cite> (1914)—almost all of the new poems (to which Mrs.
Bianchi wrote a preface of great personal value) being a
record of Emily Dickinson’s romantic friendship for her sister.</p>

<p class='c015'>The sharp quality of her work, with its cool precision and
clear imagery, makes her akin, at least in technique, to the
later Imagists. (See Preface.) But a passionate and almost
mystical warmth brings her closer to the great ones of her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>time. “An epigrammatic Walt Whitman,” some one has called
her, a characterization which, while enthusiastic to the point of
exaggeration, expresses the direction if not the execution of her
art. Technically, Emily Dickinson’s work was strikingly uneven;
many of her poems are no more than rough sketches, awkwardly
filled in; even some of her finest lines are marred by the intrusion
of merely trivial conceits or forced “thought-rhymes.”
But the best of her work is incomparable in its strange cadence
and quiet intensity. Her verses are like a box of many jewels,
sparkling in their brilliancy, cameo-like in their delicate contours,
opalescent in their buried fires.</p>

<p class='c015'>Emily Dickinson died, in the same place she was born, at
Amherst, May 15, 1886.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'><i>Thomas Bailey Aldrich</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Thomas Bailey Aldrich was born in 1836 at Portsmouth, New
Hampshire, where he spent most of the sixteen years which he
has recorded in that delightful memoir, <cite>The Story of a Bad
Boy</cite> (1869). After a brief clerkship, he became junior literary
critic of <cite>The Evening Mirror</cite> at nineteen, publishing his first
book (<cite>The Bells</cite>), an immature collection of echoes, at the same
time. From 1855 to 1866 he held various journalistic positions,
associating himself with the leading metropolitan <i>literati</i>. But
though Aldrich mingled with the New York group, he was not
part of it; he longed for the more rarefied intellectual atmosphere
of New England and when, in 1866, Osgood offered
him the editorship of <cite>Every Saturday</cite>, published in Boston,
Aldrich accepted with alacrity. A few years later he became
editor of the famous <cite>Atlantic Monthly</cite>, holding that position
from 1881 to 1890.</p>

<p class='c015'>Aldrich’s work falls into two sharply-divided classes. The
first half is full of overloaded phrase-making, fervid extravagances;
the reader sinks beneath clouds of damask, azure,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>emerald, pearl and gold; he is drowned in a sea of musk, aloes,
tiger-lilies, spice, soft music, orchids, attar-breathing dusks.
There is no real air in these verses; it is Nature as conceived
by a poet reading the Arabian Nights in a hot-house.
In company with Stoddard and Taylor, he dwelt in a literary
Orientalism—(Stoddard’s <cite>Book of the East</cite> followed fast upon
Taylor’s <cite>Poems of the Orient</cite>)—and Aldrich’s <cite>Cloth of Gold</cite>
was suffused with similar “vanilla-flavored adjectives and
patchouli-scented participles” (to quote Holmes), laboring hard
to create an exotic atmosphere by a wearisome profusion of
lotus blossoms, sandalwood, spikenard, blown roses, diaphanous
gauzes, etc.</p>

<p class='c015'>The second phase of Aldrich’s art is more human in appeal
as it is surer in artistry. He learned to sharpen his images,
to fashion his smallest lyrics with a remarkable <i>finesse</i>. “In
the little steel engravings that are the best expressions of his
peculiar talent,” writes Percy H. Boynton, “there is a fine
simplicity; but it is the simplicity of an accomplished woman
of the world rather than of a village maid.” Although
Aldrich bitterly resented the charge that he was a maker of
tiny perfections, a carver of cherry-stones, these poems of his
which have the best chance of permanence are some of the
epigrams, the short lyrics and a few of the sonnets, passionless
in tone but exquisite in design.</p>

<p class='c015'>The best of Aldrich’s diffuse poetry has been collected in an
inclusive Household Edition, published by Houghton, Mifflin
and Company. He died in 1907.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'><i>John Hay</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>John Hay was born at Salem, Indiana, in 1838, graduated
from Brown University in 1858 and was admitted to the Illinois
bar a few years later. At nineteen, when he went back to
Warsaw, the little Mississippi town where he had lived as a
boy, he dreamed only of being a poet—a poet, it must be
added, of the pleasantly conventional, transition type. But the
Civil War was to disturb his mild fantasies. He became private
secretary to Lincoln, then major and assistant adjutant-general
under General Gilmore, then secretary of the Legation
at Paris, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chargé d’affaires</span></i> at Vienna and secretary of
legation at Madrid.</p>

<p class='c015'>His few vivid <cite>Pike County Ballads</cite> came more as a happy
accident than as a deliberate creative effort. When Hay returned
from Spain in 1870, bringing with him his <cite>Castilian
Days</cite>, he still had visions of becoming an orthodox lyric poet.
But he found everyone reading Bret Harte’s short stories and
the new expression of the rude West. (See Preface.) He speculated
upon the possibility of doing something similar, translating
the characters into poetry. The result was the six racy ballads
in a vein utterly different from everything Hay wrote before or
after. The poet-politician seems to have regarded this series
somewhat in the nature of light, extempore verse, belonging to
a far lower plane than his serious publications; he talked about
them reluctantly, he even hoped that they would be forgotten.
It is difficult to say whether this regret grew because Hay,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>loving the refinements of culture, at heart hated any suggestion
of vulgarity, or because of a basic lack of courage—Hay
having published his novel of labor unrest in the early 80’s
(<cite>The Breadwinners</cite>) anonymously.</p>

<p class='c015'>The fact remains, his rhymes of Pike County have survived
all his more classical lines. They served for a time as a fresh
influence, they remain a creative accomplishment.</p>

<p class='c015'>Hay was in politics all the later part of his life, ranking as
one of the most brilliant Secretaries of State the country has
ever had. He died in 1905.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><i>Bret Harte</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>(Francis) Bret Harte was born August 25, 1839, at Albany,
New York. His childhood was spent in various cities of the
East. Late in 1853 his widowed mother went to California
with a party of relatives, and two months later, when he was
fifteen, Bret Harte and his sister followed. He dreamed even
at this age of being a poet. During the next few years he was
engaged in school-teaching, typesetting, politics, mining and
journalism, becoming editor of <cite>The Overland Monthly</cite> at San
Francisco in 1868.</p>

<p class='c015'>Harte’s fame came suddenly. Late in the sixties he had
written a burlesque in rhyme of two Western gamblers trying
to fleece a guileless Chinaman who claimed to know nothing
about cards but who, it turned out, was scarcely as innocent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>as he appeared. Harte, in the midst of writing serious poetry,
had put the verses aside as too crude and trifling for publication.
Some time later, just as <cite>The Overland Monthly</cite> was
going to press, it was discovered that the form was one page
short. Having nothing else on hand, Harte had these rhymes
set up. Instead of passing unnoticed, the poem was quoted
everywhere; it swept the West and captivated the East. When
<cite>The Luck of Roaring Camp</cite> followed, Harte became not only
a national but an international figure. England acclaimed him
and <cite>The Atlantic Monthly</cite> paid him $10,000 to write for a year
in his Pike County vein.</p>

<p class='c015'><cite>East and West Poems</cite> appeared in 1871; in 1872 he published
an enlarged <cite>Poetical Works</cite> including many earlier pieces.
His scores of short stories represent Harte at his best;
“M’liss,” “Tennessee’s Partner,” “The Outcast of Poker
Flat”—these are the work of a lesser, transplanted Dickens.
His novels are of minor importance; they are carelessly constructed,
theatrically conceived; his characters are little more
than badly-wired marionettes that betray every movement made
by their manipulator.</p>

<p class='c015'>In 1872 Harte, encouraged by his success, returned to his
native East; in 1878 he went to Germany as consul. Two years
later he was transferred to Scotland and, after five years there,
went to London, where he remained the rest of his life.
Harte’s later period remains mysteriously shrouded. He never
came back to America, not even for a visit; he ceased to correspond
with his family; he separated himself from all the
most intimate associations of his early life. He died, suddenly,
at Camberley, England, May 6, 1902.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'><i>Joaquin Miller</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Cincinnatus (Heine) Miller, or, to give him the name he
adopted, Joaquin Miller, was born in 1841 of immigrant
parents. As he himself writes, “My cradle was a covered
wagon, pointed west. I was born in a covered wagon, I am
told, at or about the time it crossed the line dividing Indiana
from Ohio.” When Miller was twelve, his family left the mid-West
with “two big heavily laden wagons, with eight yoke of
oxen to each, a carriage and two horses for mother and baby
sister, and a single horse for the three boys to ride.” The
distance covered in their cross-country exodus (they took a
roundabout route to Oregon) was nearly three thousand miles.
The time consumed, he records, “was seven months and five
days. There were no bridges, no railroad levels, nothing of the
sort.... Many times, at night, after ascending a stream to
find a ford, we could look back and see our smouldering camp-fires
of the day before.” This journey made a lasting impression
on the boy’s impressionable mind; it was this tortuous wandering
that gave Miller his reverence for the spaciousness and
glory of the West in general and the pioneer in particular.
After two years in the Oregon home, he ran away to find gold.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>At fifteen we find Miller living with the Indians as one of
them; in 1859 (at the age of eighteen) he attends a missionschool
“college” in Eugene, Oregon; between 1860 and 1865
he is express-messenger, editor of a pacifist newspaper that is
suppressed for opposing the Civil War, lawyer and, occasionally,
a poet. He holds a minor judgeship from 1866 to 1870.</p>

<p class='c015'>His first book (<cite>Specimens</cite>) appears in 1868, his second
(<cite>Joaquin et al.</cite>, from which he took his name) in 1869. No
response—not even from “the bards of San Francisco Bay” to
whom he had dedicated the latter volume. He is chagrined,
discouraged, angry. He resolves to quit America, to go to the
land that has always been the nursing-ground of poets. “Three
months later, September 1, 1870, I was kneeling at the grave of
Burns. I really expected to die there in the land of my fathers.”
He arrives in London, unheralded, unknown. He takes his manuscripts
to one publisher after another with the same negative
result. Finally, with a pioneer desperation, he prints privately
one hundred copies of his <cite>Pacific Poems</cite>, sending them out for
review. Sensation! The reversal of Miller’s fortunes is one
of the most startling in all literature. He becomes famous overnight.
He is fêted, lauded, lionized; he is ranked as an equal
of Browning, given a dinner by the Pre-Raphaelites, acclaimed
as “the great interpreter of America,” “the Bryon of
Oregon”!</p>

<p class='c015'>His dramatic success in England is easily explained. He
brought to the calm air of literary London, a breath of the
great winds of the plain. The more he exaggerated his
crashing effects, the louder he roared, the better the English
public liked it. When he entered Victorian parlors in his
velvet jacket, hip-boots and flowing hair, childhood visions of
the “wild and woolly Westerner” were realized and the very
bombast of his work was glorified as “typically American.”</p>

<p class='c015'>And yet, for all his overstressed muscularity, Miller is
strangely lacking in creative energy. His exuberance and
whipped up rhetoric cannot disguise the essential weakness of
his verse. It is, in spite of a certain breeziness and a few
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>magnificent descriptions of cañons and mountain-chains, feeble
as well as false, full of cheap heroics, atrocious taste and
impossible men and women. (See Preface.) One or two individual
poems, like “Crossing the Plains” and parts of his
apostrophes to the Sierras, the Pacific Ocean and the Missouri
river may live; the rest seem doomed to a gradual extinction.</p>

<p class='c015'>From 1872 to 1886, Miller traveled about the Continent.
In 1887 he returned to California, dwelling on the Heights,
helping to found an experimental Greek academy for aspiring
writers. He died there, after a determinedly picturesque life,
in sight of the Golden Gate, in 1913.</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>Edward Rowland Sill was born at Windsor, Connecticut, in
1841. In 1861 he was graduated from Yale and shortly thereafter
his poor health compelled him West. After various unsuccessful
experiments, he drifted into teaching, first in the high
schools in Ohio, later in the English department of the University
of California. His uncertain physical condition added
to his mental uncertainty. Unable to ally himself either with
the lethargic, conservative forces whom he hated or with the
radicals whom he distrusted, Sill became an uncomfortable
solitary; half rebellious, half resigned. During the last decade
of his life, his brooding seriousness was less pronounced, a
lighter irony took the place of his dark reflections.</p>

<p class='c015'><cite>The Hermitage</cite>, his first volume, was published in 1867, a
later edition (including later poems) appearing in 1889. His
two posthumous books are <cite>Poems</cite> (1887) and <cite>Hermione and
Other Poems</cite> (1899).</p>

<p class='c015'>Sill died, after bringing something of the Eastern culture to
the West, in 1887.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><i>Sidney Lanier</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Sidney Lanier was born at Macon, Georgia, February 3, 1842.
His was a family of musicians (Lanier himself was a skilful
performer on various instruments), and it is not surprising that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>his verse emphasizes—even overstresses—the influence of music
on poetry. He attended Oglethorpe College, graduating at the
age of eighteen (1860), and, a year later, volunteered as a
private in the Confederate army. After several months’ imprisonment
(he had been captured while acting as signal officer
on a blockade-runner), Lanier was released in February, 1865,
returning from Point Lookout to Georgia on foot, accompanied
only by his flute, from which he refused to be separated. His
physical health, never the most robust, had been frightfully
impaired by his incarceration, and he was already suffering
from tuberculosis, the rest of his life being spent in an unequal
struggle against it.</p>

<p class='c015'>He was now only twenty-three years old and the problem of
choosing a vocation was complicated by his marriage in 1867.
He spent five years in the study and practice of law, during
which time he wrote comparatively little verse. But the law
could not hold him; he felt premonitions of death and realized
he must devote his talents to art before it was too late. He
was fortunate enough to obtain a position as flautist with the
Peabody Symphony Orchestra in 1873 in Baltimore, where he
had free access to the music and literature he craved. Here
he wrote all of his best poetry. In 1879, he was made lecturer
on English in Johns Hopkins University, and it was for his
courses there that he wrote his chief prose work, a brilliant if
not conclusive study, <cite>The Science of English Verse</cite>. Besides
his poetry, he wrote several books for boys, the two most popular
being <cite>The Boy’s Froissart</cite> (1878) and <cite>The Boy’s King
Arthur</cite> (1880).</p>

<p class='c015'>Lanier’s poetry, charming though most of it is, suffers from
his all too frequent theorizing, his too conscious effort to bring
verse over into the province of pure music. He thought almost
entirely, even in his most intellectual conceptions, in terms of
musical form. His main theory that English verse has for its
essential basis not <i>accent</i> but a strict musical <i>quantity</i> is a
wholly erroneous conclusion, possible only to one who could
write “whatever turn I have for art is purely musical—poetry
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>being with me a mere tangent into which I shoot.” Lanier is
at his best in his ballads, although a few of his lyrics have a
similar spontaneity. In spite of the fact that he had rather
novel schemes of rhythm and stanza-structure, much of his work
is marred by strained effects, elaborate conceits and a kind of
verse that approaches mere pattern-making. But such a vigorous
ballad as “The Song of the Chattahoochee,” lyrics like
“Night and Day” and “The Stirrup Cup,” and parts of the
symphonic “Hymns of the Marshes” are sure of a place in
American literature. Never a great figure, he was one of the
most interesting and spiritual of our minor poets.</p>

<p class='c015'>Lanier died, a victim of his disease, in the mountains of
North Carolina, September 7, 1881.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><i>James Whitcomb Riley</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>James Whitcomb Riley, who was possibly the most widely
read native poet of his day, was born October 7, 1849, in
Greenfield, Indiana, a small town twenty miles from Indianapolis,
where he spent his later years. Contrary to the popular
belief, Riley was not, as many have gathered from his bucolic
dialect poems, a struggling child of the soil; his father was a
lawyer in comfortable circumstances and Riley was not only
given a good education but was prepared for the law. His
temperament, however, craved something more adventurous.
At eighteen he shut the heavy pages of Blackstone, slipped out
of the office and joined a traveling troupe of actors who sold
patent medicines during the intermissions. Riley’s functions
were varied: he beat the bass-drum, painted their flaring banners,
wrote local versions of old songs, coached the actors and,
when occasion arose, took part in the performance himself.</p>

<p class='c015'>Even before this time, Riley had begun to send verses to the
newspapers, frank experiments, bits of homely sentiment, simple
snatches and elaborate hoaxes—the poem “Leonainie,” published
over the initials “E. A. P.,” being accepted in many quarters
as a newly discovered poem by Poe. In 1882, when he was on
the staff of the Indianapolis <cite>Journal</cite>, he began the series of
dialect poems which he claimed were by a rude and unlettered
farmer, one “Benj. F. Johnson, of Boone, the Hoosier poet”—printing
long extracts from “Boone’s” ungrammatical and
badly-spelt letters to prove his find. A collection of these
rustic verses appeared, in 1883, as <cite>The Ole Swimmin’ Hole</cite>; and
Riley leaped into widespread popularity.</p>

<p class='c015'>Other collections followed rapidly: <cite>Afterwhiles</cite> (1887), <cite>Old-Fashioned
Roses</cite> (1888), <cite>Pipes o’ Pan at Zekesbury</cite> (1889),
<cite>Rhymes of Childhood</cite> (1890). All met an instant response;
Riley endeared himself, by his homely idiom and his childlike
ingenuity, to a countryful of readers, adolescent and adult.</p>

<p class='c015'>But Riley’s simplicity is not always as artless as it seems.
Time and again, one can see him trading wantonly on the emotions
of his unsophisticated readers; he sees them about to
smile—and broadens the point of his joke; he observes them on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>the point of tears—and pulls out the sobbing <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">tremolo</span></i> stop.
In many respects, he is patently the most artificial of those poets
who claim to give us the stuff of the soil. He is the poet of
obtrusive sentiment rather than of quiet convictions; of lulling
assurance, of philosophies that never disturb his readers, of
sweet truisms rather than searching truths.</p>

<p class='c015'>That work of his which may endure, will survive because of
the personal flavor that Riley often fused into it. Such
poems as “When the Frost is on the Punkin,” “The Raggedy
Man,” “Our Hired Girl” are a part of American folk literature;
“Little Orphant Annie” is read wherever there is a
schoolhouse or, for that matter, a nursery. In 1912 the schools
throughout the country observed his birthday.</p>

<p class='c015'>Riley died in his little house in Lockerbie Street, Indianapolis,
July 22, 1916.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><i>Eugene Field</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Although born (September 3, 1850) in St. Louis, Missouri,
Eugene Field belongs to the literature of the far West. Colorado
and the Rocky Mountain region claimed him as their own
and Field never repudiated the allegiance; he even called most
of his poetry “Western Verse.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Field’s area of education embraced New England, Missouri,
and what European territory he could cover in six months.
At twenty-three he became a reporter on the St. Louis <cite>Evening
Journal</cite>, the rest of his life being given, with a dogged devotion,
to journalism. Driven by the demands of his unique daily
columns (those on the Denver <cite>Tribune</cite> [1881–1883] and the
Chicago <cite>Daily News</cite> [1883–1895] were widely copied), Field
first capitalized and then standardized his high spirits, his
erudition, his whimsicality, his fondness for children. He
wrote so often with his tongue in his cheek that it is difficult
to say where true sentiment stops and an exaggerated sentimentality
begins. “Field,” says Fred Lewis Pattee, in his detailed
study of <cite>American Literature Since 1870</cite>, “more than
any other writer of the period, illustrates the way the old type
of literary scholar was to be modified and changed by the newspaper.
Every scrap of Field’s voluminous product was written
for immediate newspaper consumption. He patronized not at
all the literary magazines, he wrote his books not at all with
book intent—he made them up from newspaper fragments....
He was a pioneer in a peculiar province: he stands for
the journalization of literature, a process that, if carried to its
logical extreme, will make of the man of letters a mere newspaper
reporter.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Though Field still may be overrated in some quarters, there
is little doubt that certain of his child lyrics, his homely philosophic
ballads (in the vein which Harte and Riley popularized)
and his brilliant burlesques will occupy a niche in
American letters. Readers of all tastes will find much to
surprise and delight them in <cite>A Little Book of Western Verse</cite>
(1889), <cite>With Trumpet and Drum</cite> (1892), <cite>A Second Book of
Verse</cite> (1893) and those remarkable versions (and perversions)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>of Horace, <cite>Echoes from the Sabine Farm</cite> (1893) written in collaboration
with his equally adroit brother, Roswell M. Field.
A complete one-volume edition of his verse was issued in 1910.</p>

<p class='c015'>Field died in Chicago, Illinois, November 4, 1895.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'><i>Edwin Markham</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Edwin Markham was born in Oregon City, Oregon, April 23,
1852, the youngest son of pioneer parents. His father died
before he had reached his fifth year and in 1857 he was taken
by his mother to a wild valley in the Suisun Hills in central
California. Here he grew to young manhood; farming,
broncho-riding, laboring on a cattle ranch, educating himself in
the primitive country schools and supplementing his studies
with whatever books he could procure. At eighteen he determined
to be a teacher and entered the State Normal School at
San Jose. After some years he became superintendent and
principal of various schools in that locality.</p>

<p class='c015'>Since childhood, Markham had been writing verses of no
extraordinary merit, one of his earliest pieces being a typically
Bryonic echo (<cite>A Dream of Chaos</cite>) full of the high-sounding
fustian of the period. Several years before he uttered his
famous challenge, Markham was writing poems of protest,
insurrectionary in theme but conventional in effect. Suddenly,
in 1899, a new force surged through him; a sense of outrage
at the inequality of human struggle voiced itself in the sweeping
and sonorous poem, “The Man with the Hoe.” (See
Preface.) Inspired by Millet’s painting, Markham made the
bowed, broken French peasant a symbol of the poverty-stricken
toiler in all lands—his was a protest not against labor but the
drudgery, the soul-destroying exploitation of labor. “The Yeoman
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>is the landed and well-to-do farmer,” says Markham,
“you need shed no tears for him. But here in the Millet
picture is his opposite—the Hoeman; the landless, the soul-blighted
workman of the world, the dumb creature that has no
time to rest, no time to think, no time for the hopes that make
us men.” ... “The Man with the Hoe,” with its demand
for a keener sense of social responsibility, was not wholly cast
in the key of challenge. It looked to a more expansive future
when “all workers will think and all thinkers will work”; it
answered Music’s great trio of B.’s (Bach, Beethoven, Brahms)
with the need of a greater three: “Bread, Beauty and Brotherhood.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The success of the poem upon its appearance in the San
Francisco <cite>Examiner</cite> (January 15, 1899) was instantaneous and
universal. The lines appeared in every part of the globe; it
was quoted and copied in every walk of life, in the literary
world, the leisure world, the labor world. The same year of
its publication, it was incorporated in Markham’s first volume
<cite>The Man with the Hoe, and Other Poems</cite> (1899). Two years
later, his almost as well known poem was published. The same
passion that fired Markham to champion the great common
workers equipped him to write fittingly of the Great Commoner
in <cite>Lincoln, and Other Poems</cite> (1901). His later volumes are
dignified and melodious but scarcely remarkable. Never reaching
the heights of his two early classics, there are, nevertheless,
many moments of a related nobility in <cite>The Shoes of Happiness</cite>
(1914) and <cite>The Gates of Paradise</cite> (1920).</p>

<p class='c015'>Markham came East in 1901, his home being on Staten
Island, New York.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'><i>Irwin Russell</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Irwin Russell was born, June 3, 1853, at Port Gibson, Mississippi,
where he studied law and was admitted to the bar.
His restless nature and wayward disposition drove him from
one place to another, from dissipation to dissipation, from a
not too rugged health to an utter breakdown. In July, 1879,
he was forced to leave New York, working his way down to
New Orleans on a coast steamer, trying to rehabilitate himself
as reporter on the New Orleans <cite>Picayune</cite>. But illness pursued
him and the following December Russell died, cut off, in the
midst of his promise, before he had reached his twenty-seventh
year.</p>

<p class='c015'>Although Russell did not take his poetry seriously and though
the bulk of it is small, its influence has been large. Thomas
Nelson Page and Joel Chandler Harris have acknowledged
their indebtedness to him; the creator of Uncle Remus writing,
“Irwin Russell was among the first—if not the very first—of
Southern writers to appreciate the literary possibilities of the
negro character.” He entered their life, appreciated their fresh
turns of thought, saw things with that peculiar mixture of
reverence and unconscious humor that is so integral a part of
negro songs and spirituals. “Blessing the Dance” and “The
Song of the Banjo” (from Russell’s operetta <cite>Christmas-Night
in the Quarters</cite>, possibly his best known work) are excellent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>examples; faithful renderings of the mind of the old-fashioned,
simple and sententious child of the plantation. In the latter
poem the old story of Noah is told, with delightful additions,
from the colorful angle of the darky; local in its setting,
revealing in its quaint psychology.</p>

<p class='c015'>A collection of his poems appeared, with an introduction by
Joel Chandler Harris, in 1888. In 1917, a more inclusive
volume, beautifully printed, with illustrations by E. W. Kemble,
was published by The Century Co.; it was entitled <cite>Christmas-Night
in the Quarters</cite>.</p>

<p class='c015'>Russell died, in an obscure boarding house in New Orleans,
December 23, 1879.</p>

<p class='c018'>Edith Matilda Thomas was born at Chatham, Ohio, August
12, 1854. She was educated in the Normal Institute at Geneva,
Ohio, and has been living in New York since 1888.</p>

<p class='c015'>Miss Thomas is the author of some dozen books of verse,
most of them lightly lyrical in mood, although many of her
individual poems have a spiritually dramatic quality. The
best of her work may be found in <cite>Lyrics and Sonnets</cite> (1887)
and <cite>The Flower from the Ashes</cite> (1915).</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>George Edward Woodberry was born in Beverly, Mass.,
May 12, 1855, and studied at Harvard; his early efforts receiving
the approval of James Russell Lowell. From 1891 to 1904
he was Professor of Comparative Literature at Columbia University,
where he exercised a keen influence on many of the
younger writers.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>His work is decidedly romantic and classical in style, leaning
heavily toward the Tennysonian tradition. Although there is
an undercurrent of spiritual beauty throughout his poetry, he
frequently loses his power of exaltation in a rhetoric that is
both stilted and sentimental. His chief collections of verse are
<cite>The Flight and Other Poems</cite> (1900), <cite>Wild Eden</cite> (1914) and
<cite>The Roamer and Other Poems</cite> (1920). He has also written
several books of essays, criticism and biography.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'><i>H. C. Bunner</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Henry Cuyler Bunner, one of our most delightful writers of
light verse, was born at Oswego, New York, in 1855. At
twenty-two he was appointed editor of <cite>Puck</cite> (then the most
prominent of comic weeklies), a position which he held until
his death. For more than ten years he wrote almost all the
rhymed contributions to that journal—to say nothing of quantities
of short stories (his <cite>Short Sixes</cite>, first published in 1890,
are still well-known), prose paragraphs, topical parodies, editorials,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>etc. Like Field, the artist was finally buried in the
journalist; but, unlike him, Bunner kept the work of the serious
poet separate from that of the manufacturer of satiric trifles.
Yet, in spite of certain exquisite fragments in <cite>Airs from Arcady</cite>
(1884) and <cite>Rowen: Second Crop Songs</cite> (1892), Bunner is likely
to be remembered chiefly for his flippant <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vers de société</span></i>, his
skilful and grave absurdities.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Behold the Deeds!” is a splendid example of Bunner’s wit
and technical ingenuity. It is a burlesque of the old ballads in
the guise of a Chant-Royal, one of the strictest and most difficult
of the French forms. Another of his uncollected comic
pieces (“Shake, Mulleary and Go-ethe”) owes its origin to the
fact that a certain Western poet (Joaquin Miller) had composed
a poem in which the name of the author of “Faust” was
made to rhyme with “teeth.” Bunner not only adopted this
rhyme, but carried the broad satire further by mispronouncing
Molière, achieving one of his happiest compositions.</p>

<p class='c015'>Bunner’s was, at best, an artificial world, a world of graceful
compliments, polite evasions, rhymed <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">billets doux</span></i>, with light
sighs and lighter laughter tinkling among the tea-cups. Bunner
died, in New Jersey, in 1896.</p>

<p class='c018'>Lizette Woodworth Reese was born January 9, 1856, at Baltimore,
Maryland, where she has lived ever since. After an
education obtained chiefly in private schools, she taught English
in the Western High School at Baltimore.</p>

<p class='c015'>Her first book, <cite>A Branch of May</cite> (1887), seems, at first
glance, to be merely a continuation of the tradition of English
minor verse, pleasant and impersonal. But an undercurrent of
emotion, a quiet intensity, makes one go back to these simple
lyrics and prepares the reader for the charm of the ensuing
volumes.</p>

<p class='c015'><cite>A Handful of Lavender</cite> (1891), <cite>A Quiet Road</cite> (1896) and
<cite>A Wayside Lute</cite> (1909) embody an artistry which, in spite of
its old-fashioned contours, is as true as it is tender. A host
of the younger lyricists owe much of their technique to her
admirable models, and few modern sonneteers have equaled
the blended music and symbolism of “Tears.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Horace Traubel, often referred to as “Whitman’s Boswell,”
was born in Camden, New Jersey, December 19, 1858, of mixed
Jewish and Christian parentage. His scholastic education was
desultory; after leaving school he sold newspapers, worked as
an errand boy and helped his father in a stationery store.
Later he became a printer’s devil, proof-reader, reporter and
editorial writer. In 1873 Walt Whitman came to Camden,
little dreaming he would spend the remainder of his life there.
He was almost friendless, a sick man, helpless and alone. The
Traubel household welcomed him in and an extraordinary
friendship sprang up immediately between the aging poet and
the young boy. Traubel saw Whitman some part of each day
for almost twenty years. “As the years fled,” says David
Karsner in his Life of Horace Traubel, “he catered to Whitman’s
needs in a hundred different ways. He would bring Old
Walt such papers and magazines as he knew would interest
him. He ran his errands ... and assumed the details and
responsibilities connected with the publishing of the later editions
of Whitman’s books.” This intimacy is fully recorded in
Traubel’s chief work, a series of volumes, <cite>With Walt Whitman
in Camden</cite>, a compilation of extraordinary value which has
been called “Whitman’s unconscious autobiography.”</p>

<p class='c015'>It is inevitable that Traubel’s own poetry should betray the
strong influence of his great friend and hero. And yet in
several poems in <cite>Optimos</cite> (1910) and <cite>Chants Communal</cite> (1914)
Traubel achieves a personal idiom; beneath the wearying
length and repetitive phrases, he communicates the fire of the
social revolutionist, the insurgent who wrote, “I build no fires
to burn anybody up. I only build fires to light up the way.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Traubel died at Bon Echo, Ontario, Canada, where he had
gone for his health, September 8, 1919.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><i>Frank Dempster Sherman</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Frank Dempster Sherman was born at Peekskill, New York,
May 6, 1860. He entered Columbia University in 1879, where,
after graduation and a subsequent instructorship, he was made
adjunct professor in 1891 and Professor of Graphics in 1904.
He held the latter position until his death, which occurred
September 19, 1916.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>Besides being a writer of airy lyrics and epigrammatic
quatrains, Sherman was an enthusiastic genealogist and a designer
(especially of book-plates) of no little skill. As a poet,
his gift was essentially that of a writer of light verse—fragrant,
fragile, yet seldom too sentimental or brittle. Pleasant
is the name for it, a pleasantness perfumed with a pungent wit.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sherman never wearied of the little lyric; even the titles
of his volumes are instances of his penchant for the brief
melody, for the sudden snatch of song: <cite>Madrigals and Catches</cite>
(1887), <cite>Lyrics for a Lute</cite> (1890), <cite>Little-Folk Lyrics</cite> (1892),
<cite>Lyrics of Joy</cite> (1904). A sumptuous collected edition of his
poems was published, with an Introduction by Clinton Scollard,
in 1917.</p>

<p class='c018'>Charlotte Perkins Stetson Gilman was born at Hartford, Connecticut,
July 3, 1860. She began public work in 1890, lecturing
on ethics, economics and sociology; identifying herself with
the labor question and the advance of women.</p>

<p class='c015'>She has written about a dozen books, her best works being
<cite>Woman and Economics</cite> (1898) and <cite>Human Work</cite> (1904). Her
volume of verse, <cite>In This Our World</cite> (1898), hurls many a
shaft of ironic wit. Beneath the whimsical humor of “A
Conservative” and the better known “Similar Cases” (unfortunately
too long to quote) there is a sub-acid satire not easily
forgotten.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><i>Bliss Carman</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>(William) Bliss Carman was born at Fredericton, New
Brunswick, Canada, April 15, 1861, of a long line of United
Empire Loyalists who withdrew from Connecticut at the time
of the Revolutionary War. Carman was educated at the University
of New Brunswick (1879–81), at Edinburgh (1882–3)
and Harvard (1886–8). He took up his residence in the
United States about 1889 and, with the exception of short sojourns
in the Maritime Provinces, has lived there ever since.</p>

<p class='c015'>In 1893, Carman issued his first book, <cite>Low Tide on Grand
Pré: A Book of Lyrics</cite>. It was immediately successful, running
quickly into a second edition. From the outset, it was evident
that Carman possessed the true lyrical power: the ability to
fuse thought in emotion, to interpret the external world through
a personal intensity. Simple and direct in his choice of themes,
his passion made them universal. A vivid buoyancy, new to
American literature, made his worship of Nature frankly pagan
as contrasted to the moralizing tributes of most of his predecessors.
This freshness and irresponsible whimsy made Carman
the natural collaborator for Richard Hovey, and when their
first joint <cite>Songs from Vagabondia</cite> appeared in 1894 Carman’s
fame was established. (See Preface.)</p>

<p class='c015'>Although the three <cite>Vagabondia</cite> collections contain Carman’s
best known poems, several of his other volumes (he has published
almost twenty of them) vibrate with the same glowing
pulse. An almost physical radiance rises from <cite>Ballads of Lost
Haven</cite> (1897), <cite>From the Book of Myths</cite> (1902) and <cite>Songs of
the Sea Children</cite> (1904).</p>

<p class='c015'>Carman has also written several volumes of essays and, in
conjunction with Mary Perry King, has devised several poem-dances
(<cite>Daughters of Dawn</cite>, 1913) suggesting Vachel Lindsay’s
later poem-games. In his collection <cite>April Airs</cite> (1916),
although the strength is diluted and the music somewhat thinned,
the old magic persists; the spell may be overfamiliar but it is
not powerless.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><i>Richard Burton</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Richard (Eugene) Burton was born at Hartford, Connecticut,
March 14, 1861. He has taught English at various colleges
and universities since 1888, and has been head of the English
department of the University of Minnesota since 1906. His
first book, <cite>Dumb in June</cite> (1895), is, in many ways, his best. It
contains a buoyant lyricism, a more conscious use of the strain
developed in Carman and Hovey’s <cite>Songs from Vagabondia</cite>—a
mood which he has never surpassed. Much of his other verse
is far less distinctive, being what might be called “anonymous
poetry”: a poetry that has, in spite of certain excellent qualities,
little trace of the individual and practically no stamp of personality
or place. The succeeding <cite>Lyrics of Brotherhood</cite> (1899)
has a wider vision if a more limited music; several of the poems
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>in this collection reflect the hungers, dreams and unsung
melodies of the dumb and defeated multitudes. <cite>From the Book
of Life</cite> (1909) has scarcely as much power and less poetry.</p>

<p class='c015'>Besides his verse, Burton has written several books of essays,
a life of Whittier and various volumes on the drama.</p>

<p class='c018'>Oliver Herford was born in December, 1863, at Manchester,
England. He studied art in London and at Julien’s in Paris,
turned to literature as a pastime and, about 1890, came to the
United States, where he has lived ever since.</p>

<p class='c015'>Herford, celebrated as a wit as well as a draughtsman and
versifier, is the author of no less than twenty volumes of light
verse, prose pasquinades and burlesques. His <cite>The Bashful
Earthquake</cite> (1898), <cite>Rubaiyat of a Persian Kitten</cite> (1904) and
<cite>This Giddy Globe</cite> (1919) show Herford’s delicate skill and his
versatile dexterity. These volumes, like most of Herford’s, are
embellished by his own drawings, which are fully as graceful
as the accompanying verses.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>
  <h2 class='c005'><i>Richard Hovey</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Richard Hovey was born in 1864 at Normal, Illinois, and
graduated from Dartmouth in 1885. After leaving college, he
became, in rapid succession, a theologian, an actor, a journalist,
a lecturer, a professor of English literature at Barnard, a poet
and a dramatist.</p>

<p class='c015'>His first volume, <cite>The Laurel: An Ode</cite> (1889), betrayed the
overmusical influence of Lanier and gave promise of that extraordinary
facility which often brought Hovey perilously close
to the pit of mere technique. His exuberant virility found its
outlet in the series of poems published in collaboration with
Bliss Carman—the three volumes of <cite>Songs from Vagabondia</cite>
(1894, 1896, 1900). Here he let himself go completely; nothing
remained sober or static. His lines fling themselves across the
page; dance with intoxicating abandon; shout with a wild
irresponsibility; leap, laugh, carouse and carry off the reader
in a gale of high spirits. The famous <cite>Stein Song</cite> is but an
interlude in the midst of a far finer and even more rousing
poem that, with its flavor of Whitman, begins:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c021'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I said in my heart, “I am sick of four walls and a ceiling.</div>
      <div class='line'>I have need of the sky.</div>
      <div class='line'>I have business with the grass.</div>
      <div class='line'>I will up and get me away where the hawk is wheeling,</div>
      <div class='line'>Lone and high,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the slow clouds go by.</div>
      <div class='line'>I will get me away to the waters that glass</div>
      <div class='line'>The clouds as they pass....”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Hovey’s attitude to his art may be expressed in no better way
than his own words concerning the poet: “It is not his mission,”
wrote Hovey in the <cite>Dartmouth Magazine</cite>, “to write elegant
canzonettas for the delectation of the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">dilettanti</span></i>, but to comfort
the sorrowful and hearten the despairing, to champion the oppressed
and declare to humanity its inalienable rights, to lay
open to the world the heart of man—all its heights and depths,
all its glooms and glories, to reveal the beauty in things and
breathe into his fellows a love of it.” This almost too conscious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>awareness of the poet’s “mission” often marred Hovey’s
work; in responding to his program, he frequently overstressed
his ringing enthusiasm, strained his own muscularity.
But his power was as unflagging as his fraternal energy was
persuasive. And in certain quieter moods the poet rose to new
heights. The work on which he was engaged at the time of
his death is significant; <cite>Launcelot and Guenevere: A Poem in
Five Dramas</cite> is magnificent in its restrained vitality.</p>

<p class='c015'>Although the varied lyrics in <cite>Songs from Vagabondia</cite> are the
best known examples of Hovey, a more representative collection
of his riper work may be found in <cite>Along the Trail</cite> (1898).
This volume contains “Spring” and the stirring “Comrades”
in full as well as the best of his vivid fragments.</p>

<p class='c015'>Hovey died, during his thirty-sixth year, in 1900.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><i>Madison Cawein</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Madison (Julius) Cawein was born in Louisville, Kentucky,
in 1865, and spent most of his life in the state of his birth. He
wrote an enormous quantity of verse, publishing more than
twenty volumes of pleasant, sometimes exuberant but seldom
distinguished poetry. <cite>Lyrics and Idyls</cite> (1890) and <cite>Vale of
Tempe</cite> (1905) contain his most characteristic stanzas, packed
with the lush, adjectival love of Nature that led certain of his
admirers to call him (and, one must admit, the alliteration
was tempting) “the Keats of Kentucky.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Cawein’s work divides itself into two distinct veins. In the
one, he dealt with the scenes and incidents of his mountain
environment: the sag of an old house in the hills, the echoes
of a feud, rumblings of the Ku Klux Klan, the ghastly details of
a lynching. In his other mood (the one which unfortunately
possessed him the greater part of the time) he spent page after
page romanticizing Nature, touching up his already painted
lilies, polishing his thinly-plated artificialities until the base
metal showed through. He pictured all outdoors with painstaking
detail. And yet it is somehow unreal, prettified, remote.
Every now and then, with an irritating frequency, he tries to
transport his audience to a literary Fairyland; but the reader
is quickly wearied by the almost interminable procession of
fays, gnomes, nixies, elves, dryads, sprites, pucks, fauns—be
they ever so lyrical.</p>

<p class='c015'>In spite of Cawein’s too profuse lyricism, several of his pieces
will doubtless remain, though it is not likely that the survivors
will be the sugared sweetmeats by which his champions (including
William Dean Howells) set such store.</p>

<p class='c015'>Cawein died in Kentucky in 1914.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><i>William Vaughn Moody</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>William Vaughn Moody was born at Spencer, Indiana, July
1, 1869, and was educated at Harvard. After graduation, he
spent the remaining eighteen years of his life in travel and intensive
study—he taught, for eight years, at the University of
Chicago—his death coming at the very height of his creative
power.</p>

<p class='c015'><cite>The Masque of Judgment</cite>, his first work, was published in
1900. A richer and more representative collection appeared the
year following; in <cite>Poems</cite> (1901) Moody effected that mingling
of challenging lyricism and spiritual philosophy which becomes
more and more insistent. (See Preface.) Throughout his
career, and particularly in such lines as the hotly expostulating
“On a Soldier Fallen in the Philippines” and the majestic,
uncompleted “The Death of Eve,” Moody successfully achieves
the rare union of poet and preacher. “Gloucester Moors” is an
outcry against the few exploiting the many; “The Quarry”
and “An Ode in Time of Hesitation” are passionate with
prophecy. His last, extended works have an epic quality which,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>with their too-crowded details and difficult diction, will effectually
prevent them from ever becoming popular. But their importance
will grow even as Moody’s place in our literature will
eventually be a higher one than that which has yet been accorded
him.</p>

<p class='c015'>His prose play <cite>The Great Divide</cite> (1907) was strikingly successful
when produced by Henry Miller. <cite>The Faith Healer</cite>
(1909), another play in prose, because of its more exalted tone,
did not win the favor of the theatre-going public. A complete
edition of <cite>The Poems and Poetic Dramas of William Vaughn
Moody</cite> was published in 1912 in two volumes.</p>

<p class='c015'>In the summer of 1909 Moody was stricken with the illness
from which he never recovered. He died in October, 1910.</p>

      <div class='line'>Once at a simple turning of the way</div>

  <h2 class='c005'><i>George Sterling</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>George Sterling was born at Sag Harbor, New York, December
1, 1869, and educated at various private schools in the
Eastern States. He moved to the far West about 1895 and has
lived in California ever since.</p>

<p class='c015'>Of Sterling’s ten volumes of poetry, <cite>The Testimony of the
Suns</cite> (1903), <cite>A Wine of Wizardry</cite> (1908) and <cite>The House of
Orchids and Other Poems</cite> (1911) are the most characteristic.
As their titles indicate, this is poetry of a flamboyant and
rhetorical type; of luxuriant sentences and emotions decorated
in “the grand manner.” Yet Sterling has added a definite
vigor to his ornate tropes and verbal prodigality. Nor is he
always extravagant. His simpler verses, though not in his
most familiar vein, are among his best.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'><i>Edwin Arlington Robinson</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Edwin Arlington Robinson was born December 22, 1869, in
the village of Head Tide, Maine. When he was still a child,
the Robinson family moved to the nearby town of Gardiner,
which figures prominently in Robinson’s poetry as “Tilbury
Town.” In 1891 he entered Harvard College. A little collection
of verse was privately printed in 1896 and the following
year marked the appearance of his first representative work,
<cite>The Children of the Night</cite> (1897).</p>

<p class='c015'>Somewhat later, he was struggling in various capacities
to make a living in New York, five years passing before the
publication of <cite>Captain Craig</cite> (1902). This fine piece of psychology,
in the cryptic vein of Browning but in Robinson’s own
idiom, was brought to the attention of Theodore Roosevelt
(then President of the United States), who became interested in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>the work of the poet and, a few years later, offered him a place
in the New York Custom House. Robinson held this position
from 1905 to 1910, leaving it the same year which marked the
appearance of his most characteristic volume, <cite>The Town down
the River</cite>. Robinson’s three books, up to this time, showed his
clean, firmly-drawn quality; but, in spite of their excellences,
they seem little more than a succession of preludes for the
dynamic volume that was to establish him in the first rank of
American poets. <cite>The Man Against the Sky</cite>, Robinson’s fullest
and most penetrating work, appeared in 1916. (See Preface.)</p>

<p class='c015'>In all of these books there is manifest that searching for
truth, the constant questioning, that takes the place of mere
acceptance. As the work of a verbal portrait painter nothing,
with the exception of some of Frost’s pictures, has been produced
that is at once so keen and so kindly; in the half-cynical,
half-mystical etchings like “Cliff Klingenhagen,” “Miniver
Cheevy,” “Richard Cory”—lines where Robinson’s irony is inextricably
mixed with tenderness—his art is at its height.</p>

<p class='c015'>Technically, Robinson is as precise as he is dexterous; there is
never a false image or a blurred line in any of his verses
which, while adhering to the strictest models and executed
according to traditional forms, are made fresh and surprising.
It is interesting to observe how the smoothness of his rhymes,
playing against the hard outlines of his verse, emphasizes the
terse, epigrammatic vigor of poems like “The Gift of God,”
“The Field of Glory” and “The Master,” one of the finest
evocations of Lincoln which is, at the same time, a bitter commentary
on the commercialism of the times and the “shopman’s
test of age and worth.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Robinson’s blank verse is scarcely less individual. It is, in
spite of a certain unblinking seriousness, always modern, always
packed with the instant. In “Ben Johnson Entertains a
Man from Stratford” we have the clearest and most human
portrait of Shakespeare ever attempted; the lines run as fluently
as good conversation, as inevitable as a perfect melody. In his
two reanimations of the Arthurian legends, <cite>Merlin</cite> (1917) and
<cite>Launcelot</cite> (1920), Robinson, shaming the tea-table idyls of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>Tennyson, has colored the tale with somber reflections of the
collapse of old orders, the darkness of an age in ashes.</p>

<p class='c015'>Although he is often accused of holding a negative attitude
toward life, Robinson’s philosophy is essentially positive; a
dogged if never dogmatic desire for a deeper faith, a greater
light. It is a philosophy expressed in <cite>Captain Craig</cite>:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c021'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in16'>... Take on yourself</div>
      <div class='line'>But your sincerity, and you take on</div>
      <div class='line'>Good promise for all climbing; fly for truth</div>
      <div class='line'>And hell shall have no storm to crush your flight,</div>
      <div class='line'>No laughter to vex down your loyalty.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>A collection of the poet’s later verse, <cite>The Three Taverns</cite>
(1920), reflects the same high standards of conciseness and craftsmanship.
Robinson lives in Peterboro, New Hampshire, during
the summer; his home in the winter is in Brooklyn, New York.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'><i>Edgar Lee Masters</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Edgar Lee Masters was born at Garnett, Kansas, August 23,
1869, of old Puritan and pioneering stock. When he was still
a boy, the family moved to Illinois, where, after desultory
schooling, he studied law in his father’s office at Lewiston.
For a year he practised with his father and then went to
Chicago, where he became a successful and prominent attorney.</p>

<p class='c015'>Before going to Chicago, Masters had composed a great quantity
of verse in traditional forms on still more traditional
themes; by the time he was twenty-four he had written about
four hundred poems, revealing the result of wide reading and
betraying the influence of Poe, Keats, Shelley and Swinburne.
His work, previous to the publication of <cite>Spoon River Anthology</cite>,
was derivative and undistinguished. In 1895 he wrote a blank
verse play on Benedict Arnold. In 1898 he published <cite>A Book
of Verses</cite>, a selection of some sixty of the early four hundred.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>In 1902 <cite>Maximilian</cite>, another blank verse play, appeared, causing
no more comment than the others. Nothing daunted,
Masters published several volumes in rapid succession (three
books of poetry appearing, under various pseudonyms, between
1905 and 1912), <cite>The New Star Chamber and Other Essays</cite>
(1904), <cite>Blood of the Prophets</cite> (1905), <cite>Althea</cite>, a play (1907),
<cite>The Trifler</cite>, another play (1908).</p>

<p class='c015'>In 1914, Masters, at the suggestion of his friend William
Marion Reedy, turned from his preoccupation with classic
subjects and began to draw upon the life he knew for those
concise records which have made him famous. Taking as his
model <cite>The Greek Anthology</cite>, which Reedy had pressed upon
him, Masters evolved <cite>Spoon River Anthology</cite>, that astonishing
assemblage of over two hundred self-inscribed epitaphs, in
which the dead of a middle Western town are supposed to
have written the truth about themselves. Through these frank
revelations, many of them interrelated, the village is recreated
for us; it lives again, unvarnished and typical, with
all its intrigues, hypocrisies, feuds, martyrdoms and occasional
exaltations. The crippling monotony of existence in a drab
township, the defeat of ideals, the struggle toward higher goals—all
is synthesized in these crowded pages. All moods and all
manner of voices are heard here—even Masters’s, who explains
the reason for his medium and the selection of his form
through “Petit, the Poet.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The success of the volume was stupendous. (See Preface.)
With every new attack (and its frankness continued to make
fresh enemies) its readers increased; it was imitated, parodied,
reviled as “a piece of yellow journalism;” hailed as “an
American Comédie Humaine.” Finally, after the storm of controversy,
it has taken its place as a landmark in American
literature.</p>

<p class='c015'>With <cite>Spoon River Anthology</cite> Masters arrived—and left. He
went back to his first rhetorical style, resurrecting many of his
earlier trifles, reprinting dull echoes of Tennyson, imitations of
Shelley, archaic paraphrases in the manner of Swinburne.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>Yet, though none of Masters’s subsequent volumes can be compared
to his masterpiece, all of them contain examples of the
same straightforwardness, the stubborn searching for truth that
intensified his best known characterizations.</p>

<p class='c015'><cite>Songs and Satires</cite> (1916) contains the startling “All Life in a
Life” and the gravely moving “Silence.” <cite>The Great Valley</cite>
(1916) is packed with echoes and a growing dependence on
Browning. In <cite>Toward the Gulf</cite> (1918), the Browning influence
predominates, although there are such splendid individual
monologues as “The World Saver,” “St. Deseret” and
“Front the Ages with a Smile.” <cite>Starved Rock</cite> (1919) and
<cite>Domesday Book</cite> (1920) are, like all Masters’s later books,
queerly assembled mixtures of good, bad and derivative verse.
And yet, for all of this poet’s borrowings, in spite of his
cynicism and disillusion, Masters’s work is a continual searching
for some key to the mystery of truth, the mastery of life.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'><i>Stephen Crane</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Stephen Crane, whose literary career was one of the most
meteoric in American letters, was born at Newark, New Jersey,
November 1, 1871. After taking a partial course at Lafayette
College, he entered journalism at sixteen and, until the time of
his death, was a reporter and writer of newspaper sketches.
When he died, at the age of thirty, he had ten printed volumes
standing to his credit, two more announced for publication, and
two others which were appearing serially.</p>

<p class='c015'>Crane’s most famous novel, <cite>The Red Badge of Courage</cite>
(1895), was written when he was twenty-two years old.
What is even more astonishing is the fact that this detailed
description of blood and battlefields was written by a civilian
far from the scene of conflict. This novel (Crane’s second)
was an instantaneous and international success. <cite>The Atlantic
Monthly</cite> pronounced it “great enough to set a new fashion in
literature”; H. G. Wells, speaking of its influence in England,
said Crane was “the first expression of the opening mind or a
new period ... a record of an intensity beyond all precedent.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>Crane’s other books, although less powerful than <cite>The Red
Badge of Courage</cite>, are scarcely less vivid. <cite>The Open Boat</cite>
(1898) and <cite>The Monster</cite> (1899) are full of an intuitive wisdom
and a sensitivity that caused Wells to exclaim “The man
who can call these ‘brilliant fragments’ would reproach Rodin
for not ‘completing’ his fragments.”</p>

<p class='c015'>At various periods in Crane’s brief career, he experimented
in verse, seeking to find new effects in unrhymed lines, a new
acuteness of vision. The results were embodied in two volumes
of unusual poetry, <cite>The Black Riders</cite> (1895) and <cite>War Is Kind</cite>
(1899), lines that strangely anticipated the Imagists and the
epigrammatic free verse that followed fifteen years later.</p>

<p class='c015'>Besides his many novels, short stories and poems, Crane was
writing, at the time of his death, descriptions of the world’s
great battles for <cite>Lippincott’s Magazine</cite>; his droll <cite>Whilomville
Stories</cite> for boys were appearing in <cite>Harper’s Monthly</cite> and he
was beginning a series of similar stories for girls. It is more
than probable that this feverish energy of production aggravated
the illness that caused Crane’s death. He reached his
refuge in the Black Forest only to die at the journey’s end,
June 5, 1900.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><i>Edwin Ford Piper</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Edwin Ford Piper was born at Auburn, Nebraska, February 8,
1871, and literally grew up in the saddle. In 1893 he entered
the University of Nebraska, from which he received an A.B. in
1897 and A.M. in 1900. He studied at Harvard (1903–4), was
one of the editors of <cite>The Kiote</cite> (a magazine published from
1898 to 1902 in Lincoln, Nebraska), and, since 1905, has been
an instructor of English at the State University of Iowa.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span><cite>Piper’s Barbed Wire and Other Poems</cite> (1918) is saturated
with the color of his environment. His later poems are still
more vivid and racy. “Sweetgrass Range” (with its self-acknowledged
debt to Burns’s “Rattlin’ Roarin’ Willie”) and
“Bindlestiff” are fresh evidences of this author’s creative interest
in ballads and folk-lore.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><i>T. A. Daly</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Thomas Augustine Daly was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,
May 28, 1871. He attended Villanova College and
Fordham University (1889), leaving there at the end of his
sophomore year to become a newspaper man. Since 1891 he has
been on the staff of various Philadelphia journals, writing
reviews, editorials, travel-notes and, most of all, running the
columns in which his much-quoted verse originally appeared.</p>

<p class='c015'><cite>Canzoni</cite> (1906) and <cite>Carmina</cite> (1909) contain the best known
of Daly’s varied dialect verse. Although he has written in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>half a dozen different idioms including “straight” English
(<i>vide Songs of Wedlock</i>, 1916), his half-humorous, half-pathetic
interpretations of the Irish and Italian immigrants are
his <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">forte</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c015'>Seldom descending to caricature, Daly exhibits the features
and foibles of his characters without exploiting them; even the
lightest passages in <cite>McAroni Ballads</cite> (1919) are done with
delicacy and a not too sentimental appreciation.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><i>Paul Laurence Dunbar</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Paul Laurence Dunbar was born in 1872 at Dayton, Ohio,
the son of negro slaves. He was, before and after he began
to write his interpretative verse, an elevator-boy. He tried
newspaper work unsuccessfully and, in 1899, Dunbar was given
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>a minor position in the Library of Congress at Washington,
D. C.</p>

<p class='c015'>Although Dunbar wrote several volumes of short stories and
two novels, he is most at home in his verse. And even here,
his best work is not those straight, “literary English” pieces
by which he set such store, but the racy rhymes written in negro
dialect, alternately tender and mocking. Dunbar’s first collection,
<cite>Lyrics of Lowly Life</cite> (1896), contains many of his most
characteristic poems. In an introduction, in which mention
was made of the octoroon Dumas and the great Russian poet
Pushkin, who was a mulatto, William Dean Howells wrote,
“So far as I could remember, Paul Dunbar was the only man
of pure African blood and of American civilization to feel the
negro life æsthetically and express it lyrically.... His
brilliant and unique achievement was to have studied the
American negro objectively, and to have represented him as he
found him—with humor, with sympathy, and yet with what the
reader must instinctively feel to be entire truthfulness.”</p>

<p class='c015'><cite>Lyrics of the Hearthside</cite> (1899) and <cite>Lyrics of Love and
Laughter</cite> (1903) are two other volumes full of folk-stuff. And
though the final <cite>Lyrics of Sunshine and Shadow</cite> (1905) is less
original, being crowded with echoes of all kinds of poetry from
the songs of Robert Burns to the childhood rhymes of J. W.
Riley, it contains a few of Dunbar’s least-known but keenest
interpretations.</p>

<p class='c015'>Dunbar died in the city of his birth, Dayton, Ohio, February
10, 1906.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><i>Guy Wetmore Carryl</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Guy Wetmore Carryl, son of Charles Edward Carryl (see
page <a href='#Page_34'>34</a>), was born in New York City, March 4, 1873. He
graduated from Columbia University in 1895, was editor of
<cite>Munsey’s Magazine</cite>, 1895–6, and, during the time he lived
abroad (from 1897 to 1902), was the foreign representative
of various American publications.</p>

<p class='c015'>As a writer of prose he was received with no little acclaim;
his stories <cite>The Transgression of Andrew Vane</cite> (1902) and <cite>Zut
and Other Parisians</cite> (1903) held the attention of a restless
reading public. But it was as a writer of light verse that
Carryl was preëminent. Inheriting a remarkable technical gift
from his father, young Carryl soon surpassed him as well as all
other rivals in the field of brilliantly rhymed, brilliantly turned
burlesques. Although he wrote several serious poems (the best
of which have been collected in the posthumously published
<cite>The Garden of Years</cite>, 1904), Carryl’s most characteristic work
is to be found in his perversions of the parables of Æsop,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span><cite>Fables for the Frivolous</cite> (1898), the topsy-turvy interpretations
of old nursery rhymes, <cite>Mother Goose for Grownups</cite> (1900) and
the fantastic variations on the fairy tales in <cite>Grimm Tales Made
Gay</cite> (1903)—all of them with a surprising (and punning)
Moral attached.</p>

<p class='c015'>This extraordinary versifier died, before reaching the height
of his power, at the age of thirty-one, in the summer of 1904.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><i>H. H. Knibbs</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Harry Herbert Knibbs was born at Niagara Falls, October 24,
1874. After a desultory schooling, he attended Harvard for
three years when he was thirty-four. “Somebody said I took
honors in English,” says Knibbs, “but I never saw them.” He
wrote his first book, <cite>Lost Farm Camp</cite>, a novel, as a class
exercise.</p>

<p class='c015'>Half a dozen volumes followed, <cite>Overland Red</cite> (1914) and
<cite>Tang of Life</cite> (1917) being the most popular. In 1911, Knibbs
settled in Los Angeles, California, where he has lived ever
since.</p>

<p class='c015'>In <cite>Riders of the Stars</cite> (1916) and <cite>Songs of the Trail</cite> (1920),
Knibbs carries on the tradition of Bret Harte and the Pike
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>County Ballads. High-hearted verse this is, with more than
an occasional flash of poetry. To the typical Western breeziness,
Knibbs adds a wider whimsicality, a rough-shod but
nimble imagination.</p>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Out in the desert spaces, edged by a hazy blue,</div>
      <div class='line'>Davison sought the faces of the long-lost friends he knew:</div>
      <div class='line in4'>They were there, in the distance dreaming</div>

    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Davison’s face was leather; his mouth was a swollen blot,</div>

      <div class='line in4'>Wild as a dog gone loco,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Or sullen or meek, by turns,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>He mumbled a “Poco! Poco!”</div>
      <div class='line in4'>And whispered of pools and ferns.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Gold! Why his, for the finding! But water was never found,</div>
      <div class='line'>Save in deep caverns winding miles through the underground:</div>

      <div class='line in5'>Edged by the mirrored trees,</div>
      <div class='line in5'>When—Davison saw the faces!</div>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>There was Shorty who owed him money, and Billing who bossed the crowd;</div>

      <div class='line'>Gold? It was never cheaper. And Davison shook his head:</div>

      <div class='line in4'>Through lips that were cracked and dried;</div>
      <div class='line in4'>The pulse in his ear-drum fluttered:</div>
      <div class='line in4'>“I’m through with the game!” he cried.</div>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I’m through!” And he knelt and fumbled the cap of his dry canteen</div>
      <div class='line'>Then, rising, he swayed and stumbled into a black ravine:</div>
      <div class='line in4'>His ghostly comrades followed,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>For Davison’s end was near,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>And a shallow grave they hollowed,</div>

    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Bubbled the water—hidden a pick-stroke beneath the sand;</div>

  <h2 class='c005'><i>Anna Hempstead Branch</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Anna Hempstead Branch was born at New London, Connecticut.
She graduated from Smith College in 1897 and has
devoted herself to literature ever since.</p>

<p class='c015'>Her two chief volumes, <cite>The Shoes That Danced</cite> (1905) and
<cite>Rose of the Wind</cite> (1910), show a singer who is less fanciful
than philosophic. Often, indeed, she weighs down her simple
melodies with a heavy intellectuality, but, even more often,
she attains a high level of lyricism. Her lines are admirably
condensed, rich in personal value as well as poetic revelation;
they maintain a high and austere level. A typical poem is
“The Monk in the Kitchen,” which, with its spiritual loveliness
and verbal felicity, is a celebration of cleanness that gives
order an almost mystical nobility.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'><i>Amy Lowell</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Amy Lowell was born in Brookline, Massachusetts, February
9, 1874, of a long line of noted publicists and poets, the first
colonist (a Percival Lowell) arriving in Newburyport in 1637.
James Russell Lowell was a cousin of her grandfather; Abbott
Lawrence, her mother’s father, was minister to England; and
Abbott Lawrence Lowell, her brother, is president of Harvard
University.</p>

<p class='c015'>Miss Lowell obtained her early education through private
tuition and travel abroad. These European journeys were the
background upon which much of Miss Lowell’s later work is
unconsciously woven; her visits to France, Egypt, Turkey and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>Greece bore fruit, many years later, in the exotic colors of her
verse. As a young girl, she had vague aspirations toward
being a writer; but it was not until 1902, when she was twenty-eight
years old, that she definitely determined to be a poet.
For eight years she served a rigorous and solitary apprenticeship,
reading the classics of all schools and countries, studying
the technique of verse, exercising her verbal power—but never
attempting to publish a single line. In 1910 her first verse was
printed in <cite>The Atlantic Monthly</cite>; two years later her first book
appeared.</p>

<p class='c015'>This volume, <cite>A Dome of Many-colored Glass</cite> (1912), was a
strangely unpromising first book. The subjects were as conventional
as the treatment of them; the influence of Keats and Tennyson
was evident; the tone was soft and sentimental, almost
without a trace of personality. It was a queer prologue to the
vivid <cite>Sword Blades and Poppy Seed</cite> (1914), which marked
not only an extraordinary advance but a totally new individuality.
This second volume contained many distinctive poems
written in the usual forms, a score of pictorial pieces illustrating
Miss Lowell’s identification with the Imagists (see
Preface) and, possibly most important from a technical standpoint,
the first appearance in English of “polyphonic prose.”
Of this extremely flexible form, which has only begun to be
exploited, Miss Lowell, in an essay on John Gould Fletcher, has
written, “‘Polyphonic’ means ‘many-voiced,’ and the form is
so-called because it makes use of the ‘voices’ of poetry,
namely: meter, <i>vers libre</i>, assonance, alliteration, rhyme and
return. It employs every form of rhythm, even prose rhythm at
times.”</p>

<p class='c015'>It was because of such experiments in form and technique
that Miss Lowell first attracted attention and is still best
known. But, beneath her preoccupation with theories and novelty
of utterance, one listens to the skilled story-teller, to the
designer of arabesques, to the narrator who (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vide</span></i> such poems
as “A Lady,” “Vintage” and the later “Bronze Horses”)
revivifies history with creative excitement.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span><cite>Men, Women and Ghosts</cite> (1916) brims with this contagious
vitality; it is richer in variety than its predecessors, swifter in
movement, surer in artistry. It is, in common with all of Miss
Lowell’s work, best in its portrayal of the colors and sounds of
physical rather than the reactions of emotional experience.
She is, preëminently, the poet of the external world; her pictures
are as “hard and clear” as the most uncompromising
Imagist could desire. The colors with which her works are
studded seem like bits of bright enamel; every leaf and flower
has a lacquered brilliance. To compensate for the lack of personal
warmth, Miss Lowell feverishly agitates all she touches;
nothing remains quiescent. Whether she writes about a fruit
shop, or a flower-garden in Roxbury, or a window-full of red
slippers, or a string quartet, or a Japanese print—everything
flashes, leaps, startles, spins and burns with an almost savage
intensity; a dynamic speed dizzies one. Here motion frequently
takes the place of emotion.</p>

<p class='c015'>In <cite>Can Grande’s Castle</cite> (1918), Miss Lowell achieves a
broader line; the teller of stories, the bizarre decorator and
the experimentalist are finally fused. The poems in this volume
are only four in number—four polyphonic prose poems of almost
epic length, but they are extraordinarily varied in music,
sweeping in their sense of magnitude and time. <cite>Pictures of the
Floating World</cite> (1919) which followed is, in many ways, Miss
Lowell’s most personal revelation. Although there are several
pages devoted to the merely dazzling and grotesque, most of
these poems are in a quieter key; a new restraint gives unsuspected
overtones to stanzas that have much in common with
the earlier “Patterns” where the narrative, the character and
the thing observed are inextricably knit.</p>

<p class='c015'>Besides Miss Lowell’s original poetry, she has made many
studies in Japanese and Chinese poetry reflecting, even in her
own work, their Oriental colors and contours. She has also
written two volumes of critical essays: <cite>Six French Poets</cite> (1915)
and <cite>Tendencies in Modern American Poetry</cite> (1917), both of
them invaluable aids to the student of contemporary literature.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><i>Ridgely Torrence</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>(Frederic) Ridgely Torrence was born at Xenia, Ohio,
November 27, 1875, and was educated at Miami and Princeton
University. For several years he was librarian of the Astor
Library in New York City (1897-1901) and has been on several
editorial staffs since then.</p>

<p class='c015'>His first volume, <cite>The House of a Hundred Lights</cite> (1900),
bears the grave subtitle “A Psalm of Experience after Reading
a Couplet of Bidpai” and is a half-whimsical, half-searching
hodge-podge of philosophy, love lyrics, artlessness and impudence.
The influence of Omar Khayyám and Richard Hovey
is obvious but not too dominant; Torrence saves himself on
the very verge of sentimentality and rhetoric by a chuckle, an
adroit right-about-face.</p>

<p class='c015'>Torrence’s subsequent uncollected verses have a deeper
force, a more concentrated fire. In “The Bird and the Tree”
and “Eye-Witness,” he has caught something more than the
colors of certain localities—particularly of the dark belt. They
are as eloquent and moving as his <cite>Granny Maumee and Other
Plays</cite> (1917), which owe their power not only to Torrence’s
gift as a poet but to his sympathy as a folk-lyrist.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><i>Robert Frost</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Although known as the chief interpreter of the new New
England, Robert (Lee) Frost was born in San Francisco, California,
March 26, 1875. At the age of ten he came East to the
towns and hills where, for eight generations, his forefathers
had lived. After graduating from the high school at Lawrence,
Massachusetts, in 1892, Frost entered Dartmouth College, where
he remained only a few months. The routine of study was too
much for him and, determined to keep his mind free for creative
work, he decided to earn his living and became a bobbin boy in
one of the mills at Lawrence. He had already begun to write
poetry; a few of his verses had appeared in <cite>The Independent</cite>.
But the strange soil-flavored quality which even then distinguished
his lines was not relished by the editors, and the very
magazines to which he sent poems that today are famous, rejected
his verse with amazing unanimity. For twenty years
Frost continued to write his highly characteristic work in spite
of the discouraging apathy, and for twenty years the poet
remained unknown.</p>

<p class='c015'>In 1897, two years after his marriage, Frost moved his
family to Cambridge, Massachusetts, and entered Harvard in
a final determination to achieve culture. This time he followed
the cut-and-dried curriculum for two years, but at the end of
that period he stopped trying to learn and started to teach.
For three years he taught school, made shoes, edited a weekly
paper, and in 1900 became a farmer at Derry, New Hampshire.
During the next eleven years Frost labored to wrest a living
from the stubborn rocky hills with scant success. Loneliness
claimed him for its own; the ground refused to give him a
living; the literary world continued to remain oblivious of his
existence. Frost sought a change of environment and, after a
few years’ teaching at Derry and Plymouth, New Hampshire,
sold his farm and, with his wife and four children, sailed for
England in September, 1912.</p>

<p class='c015'>For the first time in his life, Frost moved in a literary world.
London was a hot-bed of poets; groups merged, dissolved and
separated over night; controversy and creation were in the air.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>Frost took his collection of poems to a publisher with few
hopes, went back to the suburban town of Beaconsfield and
turned to other matters. A few months later <cite>A Boy’s Will</cite>
(1913), his first collection, was published and Frost was recognized
at once as one of the few authentic voices of modern
poetry.</p>

<p class='c015'><cite>A Boy’s Will</cite>, unlike the later volumes, is frankly subjective;
original in outlook and idiom in spite of certain reminiscences
of Browning. Chiefly lyrical, this volume, lacking
the concentrated emotion of his subsequent works, is a significant
introduction to the following book, which has become a
contemporary classic. Early in 1914, Frost leased a small place
in Gloucestershire, his neighbors being the poets Lascelles
Abercrombie and W. W. Gibson. In the spring of the same
year, <cite>North of Boston</cite> (1914), one of the most intensely American
books ever printed, was published in England. (See
Preface.) This is, as he has called it, a “book of people.”
And it is more than that—it is a book of backgrounds as living
and dramatic as the people they overshadow. Frost vivifies a
stone wall, an empty cottage, an apple-tree, a mountain, a forgotten
wood-pile left</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c003'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>To warm the frozen swamp as best it could</div>
      <div class='line'>With the slow, smokeless burning of decay.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'><cite>North of Boston</cite>, like its successor, contains much of the finest
poetry of our time. Rich in its actualities, richer in its spiritual
values, every line moves with the double force of observation
and implication. The first poem in the book illustrates this
power of character and symbolism. Although Frost is not
arguing for anything in particular, one senses here something
more than the subterranean enemies of walls. In “Mending
Wall,” we see two elemental and opposed forces. “Something
there is that doesn’t love a wall,” insists the seeker after
causes; “Good fences make good neighbors,” doggedly maintains
the literal-minded lover of traditions. Here, beneath the
whimsical turns and pungency of expression, we have the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>essence of nationalism versus the internationalist; the struggle
between a blind responsibility and a pagan iconoclasm.</p>

<p class='c015'>So with all of Frost’s characters. Like the worn out incompetent
in “The Death of the Hired Man” (one of the finest
<i>genre</i> pictures of our time), the country boy in “Birches,” or
the positive, tight-lipped old lady in “The Black Cottage,” his
people are always intensified through the poet’s circumlocutory
but precise psychology. They remain close to their soil.
Frost’s monologs and dramatic idyls, written in a conversational
blank verse, establish the connection between the vernacular
and the language of literature; they remain rooted in realism.
But Frost is never a photographic realist. “There are,” he
once said, “two types of realist—the one who offers a good
deal of dirt with his potato to show that it is a real one; and
the one who is satisfied with the potato brushed clean. I’m
inclined to be the second kind.... To me, the thing that art
does for life is to strip it to form.”</p>

<p class='c015'>In March, 1915, Frost came back to America—to a hill outside
of Franconia, New Hampshire, to be precise. <cite>North of Boston</cite>
had been published in the United States and its author, who
had left the country an unknown writer, returned to find himself
famous. <cite>Mountain Interval</cite>, containing some of Frost’s most
beautiful poems (“Birches,” “An Old Man’s Winter Night,”
“The Hill Wife”), appeared in 1916. The idiom is the same
as in the earlier volumes, but the notes are more varied, the
convictions are stronger. The essential things are unchanged.
The first poem in Frost’s first book sums it up:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c021'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>They would not find me changed from him they knew—</div>
      <div class='line'>Only more sure of all I thought was true.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>The fanciful by-play, the sly banter, so characteristic of this
poet, has made his grimness far less “gray” than some of his
critics are willing to admit. This elfin whimsy winks through
the broad bucolic humor of “The Cow in Apple Time,” the
mock pity of “The Road Not Taken,” the tenderness of “The
Runaway” and the lovely apostrophe to an orchard in “Good-Bye
and Keep Cold.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>Frost taught at Amherst College from 1916 to 1919, but found
that his association with scholastic life took too much of his
creative energy. In 1920, therefore, he bought a few acres in
Vermont and devoted himself once more to the double labors
of farmer and poet. Through his lyrics as well as his quasi-narratives,
he has uttered (and is voicing) some of the deepest
and richest notes in American poetry.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>MENDING WALL</h3>

<div class='lg-container-b c003'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Something there is that doesn’t love a wall,</div>
      <div class='line'>That sends the frozen-ground-swell under it,</div>
      <div class='line'>And spills the upper boulders in the sun;</div>
      <div class='line'>And makes gaps even two can pass abreast.</div>
      <div class='line'>The work of hunters is another thing:</div>
      <div class='line'>I have come after them and made repair</div>
      <div class='line'>Where they have left not one stone on a stone,</div>
      <div class='line'>But they would have the rabbit out of hiding,</div>
      <div class='line'>To please the yelping dogs. The gaps I mean,</div>
      <div class='line'>No one has seen them made or heard them made,</div>
      <div class='line'>But at spring mending-time we find them there.</div>
      <div class='line'>I let my neighbor know beyond the hill;</div>
      <div class='line'>And on a day we meet to walk the line</div>
      <div class='line'>And set the wall between us once again.</div>
      <div class='line'>We keep the wall between us as we go.</div>
      <div class='line'>To each the boulders that have fallen to each.</div>
      <div class='line'>And some are loaves and some so nearly balls</div>
      <div class='line'>We have to use a spell to make them balance:</div>
      <div class='line'>“Stay where you are until our backs are turned!”</div>
      <div class='line'>We wear our fingers rough with handling them.</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>Oh, just another kind of outdoor game,</div>
      <div class='line'>One on a side. It comes to little more:</div>
      <div class='line'>There where it is we do not need the wall:</div>
      <div class='line'>He is all pine and I am apple-orchard.</div>
      <div class='line'>My apple trees will never get across</div>
      <div class='line'>And eat the cones under his pines, I tell him.</div>
      <div class='line'>He only says, “Good fences make good neighbors.”</div>
      <div class='line'>Spring is the mischief in me, and I wonder</div>
      <div class='line'>If I could put a notion in his head:</div>
      <div class='line'>“<i>Why</i> do they make good neighbors? Isn’t it</div>
      <div class='line'>Where there are cows? But here there are no cows.</div>
      <div class='line'>Before I built a wall I’d ask to know</div>
      <div class='line'>What I was walling in or walling out,</div>
      <div class='line'>And to whom I was like to give offence.</div>
      <div class='line'>Something there is that doesn’t love a wall,</div>
      <div class='line'>That wants it down!” I could say “Elves” to him,</div>
      <div class='line'>But it’s not elves exactly, and I’d rather</div>
      <div class='line'>He said it for himself. I see him there,</div>
      <div class='line'>Bringing a stone grasped firmly by the top</div>
      <div class='line'>In each hand, like an old-stone savage armed.</div>
      <div class='line'>He moves in darkness as it seems to me,</div>
      <div class='line'>Not of woods only and the shade of trees.</div>
      <div class='line'>He will not go behind his father’s saying,</div>
      <div class='line'>And he likes having thought of it so well</div>
      <div class='line'>He says again, “Good fences make good neighbors.”</div>

<h3 class='c011'>THE TUFT OF FLOWERS</h3>

<div class='lg-container-b c003'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I went to turn the grass once after one</div>
      <div class='line'>Who mowed it in the dew before the sun.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>The dew was gone that made his blade so keen</div>
      <div class='line'>Before I came to view the levelled scene.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I looked for him behind an isle of trees;</div>
      <div class='line'>I listened for his whetstone on the breeze.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>But he had gone his way, the grass all mown,</div>
      <div class='line'>And I must be, as he had been,—alone,</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“As all must be,” I said within my heart,</div>
      <div class='line'>“Whether they work together or apart.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>But as I said it, swift there passed me by</div>

    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Seeking with memories grown dim over night</div>
      <div class='line'>Some resting flower of yesterday’s delight.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And once I marked his flight go round and round,</div>
      <div class='line'>As where some flower lay withering on the ground.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And then he flew as far as eye could see,</div>
      <div class='line'>And then on tremulous wing came back to me.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I thought of questions that have no reply,</div>
      <div class='line'>And would have turned to toss the grass to dry;</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>But he turned first, and led my eye to look</div>
      <div class='line'>At a tall tuft of flowers beside a brook,</div>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>A leaping tongue of bloom the scythe had spared</div>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Nor yet to draw one thought of ours to him,</div>

      <div class='line'>This saying good-bye on the verge of the dark</div>
      <div class='line'>And cold to an orchard so young in the bark,</div>
      <div class='line'>Reminds me of all that can happen to harm</div>
      <div class='line'>An orchard away at the end of the farm</div>
      <div class='line'>All winter cut off by a hill from the house.</div>

<div class='lg-container-b c003'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Once when the snow of the year was beginning to fall,</div>
      <div class='line'>We stopped by a mountain pasture to say “Whose colt?”</div>
      <div class='line'>A little Morgan had one forefoot on the wall,</div>
      <div class='line'>The other curled at his breast. He dipped his head</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>And snorted to us. And then he had to bolt.</div>
      <div class='line'>We heard the miniature thunder where he fled</div>
      <div class='line'>And we saw him or thought we saw him dim and grey,</div>
      <div class='line'>Like a shadow against the curtain of falling flakes.</div>
      <div class='line'>“I think the little fellow’s afraid of the snow.</div>

      <div class='line'>And mounts the wall again with whited eyes</div>
      <div class='line'>And all his tail that isn’t hair up straight.</div>
      <div class='line'>He shudders his coat as if to throw off flies.</div>

      <div class='line'>But swinging doesn’t bend them down to stay.</div>
      <div class='line'>Ice-storms do that. Often you must have seen them</div>
      <div class='line'>Loaded with ice a sunny winter morning</div>
      <div class='line'>After a rain. They click upon themselves</div>
      <div class='line'>As the breeze rises, and turn many-colored</div>
      <div class='line'>As the stir cracks and crazes their enamel.</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>Soon the sun’s warmth makes them shed crystal shells</div>
      <div class='line'>Shattering and avalanching on the snow-crust—</div>
      <div class='line'>Such heaps of broken glass to sweep away</div>
      <div class='line'>You’d think the inner dome of heaven had fallen.</div>
      <div class='line'>They are dragged to the withered bracken by the load,</div>
      <div class='line'>And they seem not to break; though once they are bowed</div>
      <div class='line'>So low for long, they never right themselves:</div>
      <div class='line'>You may see their trunks arching in the woods</div>
      <div class='line'>Years afterwards, trailing their leaves on the ground</div>
      <div class='line'>Like girls on hands and knees that throw their hair</div>
      <div class='line'>Before them over their heads to dry in the sun.</div>
      <div class='line'>But I was going to say when Truth broke in</div>
      <div class='line'>With all her matter-of-fact about the ice-storm</div>
      <div class='line'>I should prefer to have some boy bend them</div>
      <div class='line'>As he went out and in to fetch the cows—</div>
      <div class='line'>Some boy too far from town to learn baseball,</div>
      <div class='line'>Whose only play was what he found himself,</div>
      <div class='line'>Summer or winter, and could play alone.</div>
      <div class='line'>One by one he subdued his father’s trees</div>
      <div class='line'>By riding them down over and over again</div>
      <div class='line'>Until he took the stiffness out of them,</div>
      <div class='line'>And not one but hung limp, not one was left</div>
      <div class='line'>For him to conquer. He learned all there was</div>
      <div class='line'>To learn about not launching out too soon</div>
      <div class='line'>And so not carrying the tree away</div>
      <div class='line'>Clear to the ground. He always kept his poise</div>
      <div class='line'>To the top branches, climbing carefully</div>
      <div class='line'>With the same pains you use to fill a cup</div>
      <div class='line'>Up to the brim, and even above the brim.</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>Then he flung outward, feet first, with a swish,</div>
      <div class='line'>Kicking his way down through the air to the ground.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>So was I once myself a swinger of birches;</div>

      <div class='line'>Broken across it, and one eye is weeping</div>
      <div class='line'>From a twig’s having lashed across it open.</div>
      <div class='line'>I’d like to get away from earth awhile</div>
      <div class='line'>And then come back to it and begin over.</div>
      <div class='line'>May no fate wilfully misunderstand me</div>

      <div class='line'>Not to return. Earth’s the right place for love:</div>
      <div class='line'>I don’t know where it’s likely to go better.</div>
      <div class='line'>I’d like to go by climbing a birch tree,</div>

      <div class='line'><i>Toward</i> heaven, till the tree could bear no more,</div>
      <div class='line'>But dipped its top and set me down again.</div>

  <h2 class='c005'><i>William Ellery Leonard</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>William Ellery Leonard was born at Plainfield, New Jersey,
January 25, 1876. He received his A.M. at Harvard in 1899
and completed his studies at the Universities of Göttingen and
Bonn. After traveling for several years throughout Europe,
he became a teacher and has been professor of English in the
University of Wisconsin since 1906.</p>

<p class='c015'><cite>The Vaunt of Man</cite> (1912) is Leonard’s most representative
volume. Traditional in form and material, it is anything but
conservative in spirit. Leonard’s insurrectionary fervor speaks
sonorously in the simplest of his quatrains and the strictest of
his sonnets. This protesting passion is given an even wider
sweep in <cite>The Lynching Bee</cite> (1920), the title-poem being a
terrific indictment in which the poet’s outrage speaks with a
new ironism.</p>

<p class='c015'>Besides his original poetry, Leonard has published several
volumes of translations from the Greek and Latin as well as
a series of paraphrases of the fables of Æsop.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>
  <h2 class='c005'><i>Carl Sandburg</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Carl (August) Sandburg was born of Swedish stock at
Galesburg, Illinois, January 6, 1878. His schooling was haphazard;
at thirteen he went to work on a milk wagon. During
the next six years he was, in rapid succession, porter in a barber-shop,
scene-shifter in a cheap theatre, truck-handler in a brickyard,
turner apprentice in a pottery, dish-washer in Denver
and Omaha hotels, harvest hand in Kansas wheat fields. These
tasks equipped him, as no amount of learning could have done,
to be the laureate of industrial America. When war with
Spain was declared in 1898, Sandburg, avid for fresh adventure,
enlisted in Company C., Sixth Illinois Volunteers.</p>

<p class='c015'>On his return from the campaign in Porto Rico, Sandburg
entered Lombard College in Galesburg and, for the first time,
began to think in terms of literature. He had already seen a
great deal of the world from the roaring alleys of great cities
as well as from the underside of box-cars; he had loafed,
fought and expressed himself richly. So, what with the fact
that the “terrible Swede,” as captain of the basket-ball team,
won a series of new victories, it is little wonder that he was
idolized by his class-mates and elected editor-in-chief of the
college paper.</p>

<p class='c015'>After leaving college he did all manner of things to earn a
living. He was advertising manager for a department store
and worked as district organizer for the Social-Democratic
party of Wisconsin. He became a salesman, a pamphleteer, a
newspaperman. On the staff of a business magazine, he became
a “safety first” expert; his articles on accident prevention
bringing him before manufacturers’ conventions where he talked
about machinery safeguards and methods found successful in
reducing injuries in factory organizations.</p>

<p class='c015'>In 1904, Sandburg published the proverbial “slender sheaf”;
a tiny pamphlet of twenty-two poems, uneven in quality but
strangely like the work of the mature Sandburg in feeling.
What is more, these experiments anticipated the very inflection
of the later poems, with their spiritual kinship to Henley,
Lincoln and Whitman; several of these early experiments (with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>the exception of the rhymed verses) might be placed, without
seeming incongruous, in the most recent collection of Sandburg’s
pieces. The idiom of <cite>Smoke and Steel</cite> (1920) is more
intensified, but it is the same idiom as that of “Milville”
(1903), which begins:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c021'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Down in southern New Jersey they make glass.</div>
      <div class='line'>By day and by night, the fires burn on in Milville and bid the sand let in the light.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Meanwhile the newspaperman was having a hard struggle to
keep the poet alive. Until he was thirty-six years old, Sandburg
was totally unknown to the literary world. In 1914 a
group of his poems appeared in <cite>Poetry; A Magazine of Verse</cite>;
later the same year one of the group (the now famous “Chicago”)
was awarded the Levinson prize of two hundred
dollars. A little more than a year later his first, full-fledged
book was published, and Sandburg—tardily but triumphantly—had
arrived.</p>

<p class='c015'><cite>Chicago Poems</cite> (1916) is full of ferment; it seethes with a
direct poetry surcharged with tremendous energy. Here is an
almost animal exultation that is also an exaltation. Sandburg’s
speech is simple and powerful; he uses slang as freely (and
beautifully) as his predecessors used the now archaic tongue
of their times. (See Preface.) Immediately the cries of protest
were heard: Sandburg was coarse and brutal; his work
ugly and distorted; his language, unrefined, unfit for poetry.
His detractors forgot that Sandburg was only brutal when
dealing with brutality; that beneath his toughness, he was one
of the tenderest of living poets; that, when he used colloquialisms
and a richly metaphorical slang, he was searching
for new poetic values in “limber, lasting, fierce words”—unconsciously
answering Whitman who asked, “Do you suppose
the liberties and brawn of These States have to do only with
delicate lady-words? With gloved gentleman-words?”</p>

<p class='c015'><cite>Cornhuskers</cite> (1918) is another step forward; it is fully as
sweeping as its forerunner and far more sensitive. The gain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>in power and restraint is evident in the very first poem, a
magnificent panoramic vision of the prairie. Here is something
of the surge of a Norse saga; <cite>Cornhuskers</cite> is keen with a salty
vigor, a vast sympathy for all that is splendid and terrible in
Nature. But the raw violence is restrained to the point of
mysticism. There are, in this volume, dozens of those delicate
perceptions of beauty that must astonish those who think that
Sandburg can write only a big-fisted, rough-neck sort of poetry.
“Cool Tombs,” one of the most poignant lyrics of our time,
moves with a new music; “Grass” whispers as quietly as the
earlier “Fog” stole in on stealthy, cat feet.</p>

<p class='c015'><cite>Smoke and Steel</cite> (1920) is the synthesis and sublimation of its
predecessors. In this ripest of his collections, Sandburg has
fused mood, accent and image in a new intensity. It is a fit
setting for the title-poem; it is, in spite of certain over-mystical
accents, an epic of industrialism. Smoke-belching chimneys are
here, quarries and great boulders of iron-ribbed rock; here are
titanic visions: the dreams of men and machinery. And silence
is here—the silence of sleeping tenements and sun-soaked cornfields.
<cite>Smoke and Steel</cite> is a rich amalgam; indigenous to the
core. And what makes it so vital is Sandburg’s own spirit: a
never-sated joy in existence, a continually fresh delight in the
variety and wonder of life.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><i>Adelaide Crapsey</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Adelaide Crapsey was born, September 9, 1878, at Rochester,
New York, where she spent her childhood. She entered Vassar
College in 1897, graduating with the class of 1901. Two years
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>after graduation she began work as a teacher of History and
Literature, in Kemper Hall, Kenosha, Wisconsin, where she
had attended preparatory school. In 1905 she went abroad,
studying archaeology in Rome. After her return she essayed to
teach again but her failing health compelled her to discontinue
and though she became instructor in Poetics at Smith College
in 1911, the burden was too great for her.</p>

<p class='c015'>Prior to this time she had written little verse, her chief work
being an analysis of English metrics, an investigation (which
she never finished) of certain problems in verse structure. In
1913, after her breakdown, she began to write those brief lines
which, like some of Emily Dickinson’s, are so precise and
poignant. She was particularly happy in her “Cinquains,” a
form that she originated. These five-line stanzas in the strictest
possible structure (the lines having, respectively, two, four, six,
eight and two syllables) doubtless owe something to the
Japanese <i>hokku</i>, but Adelaide Crapsey saturated them with her
own fragile loveliness.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Her death,” writes her friend, Claude Bragdon, “was
tragic. Full of the desire of life she was forced to go, leaving
her work all unfinished.” She died at Saranac Lake, New York,
on October 8, 1914. Her small volume <cite>Verse</cite> appeared in 1915,
and a part of the unfinished <cite>Study in English Metrics</cite> was
posthumously published in 1918.</p>

<p class='c018'>Grace Hazard Conkling was born in 1878 in New York City.
After graduating from Smith College in 1899, she studied music
at the University of Heidelberg (1902-3) and Paris (1903-4).
Since 1914 she has been a teacher of English at Smith College,
where she has done much to create an alert interest in poetry.</p>

<p class='c015'>Mrs. Conkling’s <cite>Afternoons of April</cite> (1915) and <cite>Wilderness

the whisper of flutes above a plaintive English horn, rises from
her pages. But the poems are by no means monotonous. A
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>fragrant whimsicality, a childlike freshness vivifies poems like
“The Whole Duty of Berkshire Brooks,” “Dilemma” and
“Frost on a Window,” which reminds one of the manner of

  <h2 class='c005'><i>James Branch Cabell</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>James Branch Cabell was born at Richmond, Virginia, April
14, 1879. He taught French and Greek for two years at William
and Mary College (1896-7), worked in the pressroom of the
Richmond <cite>Times</cite> (1898), was on the staff of the New York
<cite>Herald</cite> (1899-1901) and began contributing to the magazines
in 1902, writing over sixty short stories as well as scattered
essays, translations and papers on historical and biographical
subjects.</p>

<p class='c015'>Although Cabell likes to describe himself as a genealogist, he
is the author of some of the most exquisite prose in contemporary
literature. But it is a prose that rises high above its own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>beauty of style. In books like <cite>The Certain Hour</cite> (1916), <cite>The
Cream of the Jest</cite> (1917), <cite>Jurgen</cite> (1919) and the poetry-crammed
“comedy of appearances,” <cite>Figures of Earth</cite> (1921), the composite
Cabell hero emerges, triumphant in the midst of his
defeats—the eternally disillusioned, eternally hopeful Jurgen-Charteris-Kennaston:
a symbol of the human soul seeking
some sort of finality, some assurance in a world of illimitable
perplexities.</p>

<p class='c015'>Though Cabell is best known as a novelist, his books are
liberally dotted with original verses that do duty as chapter-headings,
mottoes, tail-pieces, interpolated songs and epilogues.
A complete volume of his verse, <cite>From the Hidden Way</cite> (1916),
bore the subtitle “Being Seventy-Five Adaptations.” It purported
to be paraphrases from forgotten troubadours like
Allesandro de Medici, Antoine Riczi, Charles Garnier and half
a dozen other obscure Parnassians. Cabell even quoted the
first lines of each of their poems in the original Latin, French
or Provençal. Even after the hoax was exposed, it was difficult
for most readers to believe that the entire collection—names,
references, first lines in the “original” and all—were
the creation of Cabell, the masquerader.</p>

<p class='c015'>In <cite>From the Hidden Way</cite>, the romancer has added another
story to that gem-studded ivory tower in which Cabell lives
and escapes the modern world. Whether he echoes the mediæval
ballata or the more modern rondeau, roundel and
sonnet, his is an artifice solidly erected upon art.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'><i>Vachel Lindsay</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>(Nicholas) Vachel Lindsay was born in the house where he
still lives in Springfield, Illinois, November 10, 1879. His home
is next door to the Executive mansion of the State of Illinois;
from the window where Lindsay does most of his writing, he
saw many Governors come and go, including the martyred
John P. Altgeld, whom he has celebrated in one of his finest
poems. He graduated from the Springfield High School, attended
Hiram College (1897-1900), studied at the Art Institute
at Chicago (1900-3) and at the New York School of Art (1904).
After two years of lecturing and settlement work, he took the
first of his long tramps, walking through Florida, Georgia and
the Carolinas, preaching “the gospel of beauty,” and formulating
his unique plans for a communal art. (See Preface.)
During the following five years, Lindsay made several of these
trips, travelling as a combination missionary and minstrel.
Like a true revivalist, he attempted to wake in the people he
met, a response to beauty; like Tommy Tucker, he sang, recited
and chanted for his supper, distributing a little pamphlet entitled
“Rhymes to be Traded for Bread.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Lindsay began to create more poetry to reach the public—all
of his verse being written in his rôle of apostle. He was,
primarily, a rhyming John the Baptist singing to convert the
heathen, to stimulate and encourage the half-hearted dreams
that hide and are lost in our sordid villages and townships.
But the great audiences he was endeavoring to reach did not
hear him, even though his collection <cite>General Booth Enters Into
Heaven</cite> (1913) struck many a loud and racy note.</p>

<p class='c015'>Lindsay broadened his effects, developed the chant and, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>following year, published his <cite>The Congo and Other Poems</cite>
(1914), an infectious blend of rhymes, ragtime and religion.
In the title-poem and, in a lesser degree, the three companion
chants, Lindsay struck his most powerful—and most popular—vein.
They gave people (particularly when intoned aloud) that
primitive joy in syncopated sound that is at the very base of
song. In these experiments in breaking down the barriers between
poetry and music, Lindsay (obviously infected by the
echolalia of Poe’s “Bells”) tried to create what he called a
“Higher Vaudeville” imagination, carrying the form back to
the old Greek precedent where every line was half-spoken,
half-sung.</p>

<p class='c015'>Lindsay’s innovation succeeded at once. The novelty, the
speed, the clatter forced the attention of people who had never
paid the slightest heed to the poet’s quieter verses. Men heard
the <i>sounds</i> of energetic America in these lines even when they
were deaf to its spirit. They failed to see that, beneath the
noise of “The Kallyope Yell” and “The Sante Fé Trail,”
Lindsay was partly an admirer, partly an ironical critic of the
shrieking energy of these states. By his effort to win the enemy
over, Lindsay had persuaded the proverbially tired business man
to listen at last. But, in overstressing the vaudeville features,
there arose the danger of Lindsay the poet being lost in Lindsay
the entertainer. The sympathetic and colorful studies of negro
spirits and psychology (seen at their best in “The Congo,”
“John Brown” and “Simon Legree”) degenerated into the
crude buffooneries of “The Daniel Jazz” and “The Blacksmith’s
Serenade.”</p>

<p class='c015'>But Lindsay’s earnestness, keyed up by an exuberant fancy,
saved him. <cite>The Chinese Nightingale</cite> (1917) begins with one
of the most whimsical pieces Lindsay has ever devised. And if
the subsequent <cite>The Golden Whales of California</cite> (1920) is less
distinctive, it is principally because the author has written too
much and too speedily to be self-critical. It is his peculiar
appraisal of loveliness, the rollicking high spirits joined to a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>stubborn evangelism, that makes Lindsay so representative a
product of his environment.</p>

<p class='c015'>Besides his original poetry, Lindsay has embodied his experiences
and meditations on the road in two prose volumes,
<cite>A Handy Guide for Beggars</cite> (1916) and <cite>Adventures While
Preaching the Gospel of Beauty</cite> (1914), as well as a prophetic
study of the “silent drama,” <cite>The Art of the Moving Picture</cite>
(1915).</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>Edwin Meade Robinson (no relation to Edwin Arlington
Robinson) was born November 1, 1879, at Lima, Indiana. He
engaged in newspaper work when he was scarcely out of his
’teens, joining the staff of the Indianapolis <cite>Sentinel</cite> in 1901.
He began writing a daily poem in 1904 and, for years, has
conducted a column of prose and verse in the Cleveland <cite>Plain
Dealer</cite>.</p>

<p class='c015'><cite>Mere Melodies</cite> (1918) is a collection of Robinson’s light and
sentimental verse, an uneven collection. <cite>Piping and Panning</cite>
(1920) is a much fresher and far more vigorous assembling of
this versifier’s humorous and burlesque idioms. One of our
most adroit technicians, he is especially happy in interior
rhyming; a poem like “Halcyon Days” contains, beside the
end-rhymes, rhymes hidden within the lines and others running
over from line to line.</p>

      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>At eight, he ate up authors like a literary cannibal,</div>

    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>At twelve, he learned orthometry, and started in to master all</div>

    <div class='group'>

  <h2 class='c005'><i>Franklin P. Adams</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Franklin P. Adams, better known to the readers of his column
as F. P. A., was born at Chicago, Illinois, November 15, 1881.
He attended the University of Michigan (1899-1900) and, after
a brief career as an insurance agent, plunged into journalism.
Adams had already been an ardent contributor to B. L. T.’s
“A Line o’ Type or Two” and, in 1903, he began conducting
a column of his own on the Chicago <cite>Journal</cite>. Late in 1904, he
came to New York, running his “Always in Good Humor”
section on <cite>The Evening Mail</cite> until 1914, when he started “The
Conning Tower” for the New York <cite>Tribune</cite>.</p>

<p class='c015'>Adams is the author of five volumes of a light verse that is
not only skilful but energetic as well as facile. <cite>Tobogganing
on Parnassus</cite> (1909), <cite>In Other Words</cite> (1912), <cite>By and Large</cite>
(1914), <cite>Weights and Measures</cite> (1917) and <cite>Something Else
Again</cite> (1920) reveal a spirit which is essentially one of mockery.
One admires these books for their impudent—and faithful—paraphrases
of Horace and Propertius, for their last line
twists <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la</span></i> O. Henry, (with whom Adams wrote a comic opera
that never reached New York), for the ease with which their
author springs his surprises and, perhaps most of all, for
the healthy satire that runs sharply through all of his colloquial
and dexterous lines.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'><i>John G. Neihardt</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>John Gneisenau Neihardt was born at Sharpsburg, Illinois,
January 8, 1881. He completed a scientific course at Nebraska
Normal College in 1897 and lived among the Omaha Indians for
six years (1901-7), studying their customs, characteristics and
legends.</p>

<p class='c015'>Although he had already published two books, <cite>A Bundle of
Myrrh</cite> (1908) was his first volume to attract notice. It was
full of spirit, enthusiasm and an insistent virility—qualities
which were extended (and overemphasized) in <cite>Man-Song</cite>
(1909). Neihardt found a richer note and a new restraint in
<cite>The Stranger at the Gate</cite> (1911); the best of the lyrics from
these three volumes appearing in <cite>The Quest</cite> (1916).</p>

<p class='c015'>Neihardt meanwhile had been going deeper into folk-lore,
the results of which appeared in <cite>The Song of Hugh Glass</cite>
(1915) and <cite>The Song of Three Friends</cite> (1919). The latter,
in 1920, divided the annual prize offered by the Poetry Society,
halving the honors with Gladys Cromwell’s <cite>Poems</cite>. These two
of Neihardt’s are detailed long poems, part of a projected epic
series celebrating the winning of the West by the pioneers.
What prevents both volumes from fulfilling the breadth at
which they aim is the disparity between the author’s story and
his style; essentially racy narratives are recited in an archaic
and incongruous speech. Yet, in spite of a false rhetoric and
a locution that considers prairies and trappers in terms of
“Ilion,” “Iseult,” “Clotho,” the “dim far shore of Styx,”
Neihardt has achieved his effects with no little skill. Dramatic,
stern, and conceived with a powerful dignity, his major works
are American in feeling if not in execution.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><i>Witter Bynner</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Witter Bynner was born at Brooklyn, New York, August 10,
1881. He was graduated from Harvard in 1902 and has been
assistant editor of various periodicals as well as adviser to
publishers. Recently, he has spent much of his time lecturing
on poetry and travelling in the Orient.</p>

<p class='c015'><cite>Young Harvard</cite> (1907), the first of Bynner’s volumes, was,
as the name implies, a celebration of his <i>alma mater. The New
World</i> (1915) is a much riper and far more ambitious effort.
In this extended poem, Bynner sought—almost too determinedly—to
translate the ideals of democracy into verse. Neither of
these volumes displays its author’s gifts at their best, for
Bynner is, first of all, a lyric poet. <cite>Grenstone Poems</cite> (1917)
and <cite>A Canticle of Pan</cite> (1920) reveal a more natural singing
voice. Bynner harmonizes in many keys; transposing, modulating
and shifting from one tonality to another. This very
ease is his chief defect, for Bynner’s facility leads him not only
to write too much but in too many different styles. Many of
his poems seem like sounding-boards that echo the tones of
every poet except the composer of them. Instead of a fusion of
gifts we have, too often, a disintegration.</p>

<p class='c015'>When Bynner is least dexterous he is most ingratiating.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>When he does not try to sound the whole gamut of modern
poetry from the lyrics of A. E. Housman to the attenuated
epigrams of Ezra Pound, he can strike his own note with clarity
and precision. Even in <cite>The Beloved Stranger</cite> (1919), where
the borrowed accents of his <i>alter ego</i> are only too apparent, one
is arrested by lines of musical charm and fluency.</p>

<p class='c015'>Under the pseudonym “Emanuel Morgan,” Bynner was coauthor
with Arthur Davison Ficke (writing under the name of
“Anne Knish”) of <cite>Spectra</cite> (1916). <cite>Spectra</cite> was a serious
burlesque of some of the extreme manifestations of modern
poetic tendencies—a remarkable hoax that deceived many of
the radical propagandists as well as most of the conservative
critics.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'><i>James Oppenheim</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>James Oppenheim was born at St. Paul, Minnesota, May 24,
1882. Two years later his family moved to New York City,
where he has lived ever since. After a public school education,
he took special courses at Columbia University (1901-3)
and engaged in settlement work, acting in the capacity of
assistant head worker of the Hudson Guild Settlement, and
superintendent of the Hebrew Technical School for Girls
(1904-7). His studies and experiences on the lower East Side
of New York furnished the material for his first, and most
popular, book of short stories, <cite>Doctor Rast</cite> (1909).</p>

<p class='c015'>Oppenheim’s initial venture as a poet, <cite>Monday Morning and
Other Poems</cite> (1909), was a tentative collection; half imitative,
half experimental. In spite of its obvious indebtedness to
Whitman, most of the verses are in formal meters and regular
(though ragged) rhyme. Beauty is sought but seldom captured
here; the message is coughed out between bursts of eloquence
and fits of stammering.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>With <cite>Songs for the New Age</cite> (1914) Oppenheim became his
own liberator. The stammering has gone, the uncouth dissonances
have resolved. One listens to a speech that, echoing
the Whitmanic sonority, develops a music that is strangely
Biblical and yet local. It is the expression of an ancient
people reacting to modernity, of a race in solution. (See
Preface.) This volume, like all of Oppenheim’s subsequent
work, is analysis in terms of poetry; a slow searching beneath
the musical surface that attempts to diagnose the twisted
soul of man and the twisted times he lives in. The old Isaiah
note, with a new introspection, rises out of such poems as “The
Slave,” “We Dead,” “Tasting the Earth”; the music and
imagery of the Psalms are heard in “The Flocks,” “The Tree”
and “The Runner in the Skies.”</p>

<p class='c015'><cite>War and Laughter</cite> (1916) holds much of its predecessor’s
exaltation and an almost ecstatic discontent. The Semitic
blend of delight and disillusion—that quality which hates the
world for its shams and hypocrisies and loves it in spite of
them—is revealed in “Greed,” in the ironic “Report on the
Planet Earth” and the brightly affirmative “Laughter.”</p>

<p class='c015'><cite>The Book of Self</cite> (1917) is less notable, an imperfect fusion.
Oppenheim’s preoccupation with analytical psychology mars the
effect of the long passages which, in themselves, contain flashes
of clairvoyance. <cite>The Solitary</cite> (1919) is a great stride forward;
its major section, a long symbolic poem called “The
Sea,” breathes the same note that was the burden of the earlier
books—“We are flesh on the way to godhood”—with greater
strength and still greater control.</p>

<p class='c015'>Besides his poetry, Oppenheim has published several volumes
of short stories, four novels, and two poetic plays. During
1916-17 he was editor of that promising but short-lived magazine,
<cite>The Seven Arts</cite>.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><i>Alice Corbin</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Alice Corbin (Mrs. William Penhallow Henderson) was
born in St. Louis, Missouri. She has been Associate Editor of
<cite>Poetry; A Magazine of Verse</cite> since 1912, co-editing (with
Harriet Monroe) <cite>The New Poetry, An Anthology</cite> (1917).
Since 1916 she has lived in New Mexico.</p>

<p class='c015'><cite>The Spinning Woman of the Sky</cite> (1912) contains few hints of
originality. It is cast in an entirely different key than Miss
Corbin’s later efforts. Her recent verses, many of them uncollected,
are much richer; they reveal a close contact with
primitive people and native folk-lore. Her southern and far
western sketches are particularly colorful; a volume of New
Mexico studies, <cite>Red Earth</cite> (1920), being full of noteworthy
and sympathetic records.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><i>Lola Ridge</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Lola Ridge was born in Dublin, Ireland, leaving there in
infancy and spending her childhood in Sydney, Australia.
After living some years in New Zealand, she returned to
Australia to study art. In 1907, she came to the United
States, supporting herself for three years by writing fiction for
the popular magazines. She stopped this work only, as she
says, “because I found I would have to do so if I wished to
survive as an artist.” For several years she earned her living
in a variety of ways—as organizer for an educational movement,
as advertisement writer, as illustrator, artist’s model,
factory-worker, etc. In 1918, <cite>The New Republic</cite> published her
long poem <cite>The Ghetto</cite> and Miss Ridge, until then totally unknown,
became the “discovery” of the year.</p>

<p class='c015'>Her volume <cite>The Ghetto and Other Poems</cite> (1918) contains one
poem that is brilliant, several that are powerful and none that
is mediocre. Her title-poem is its pinnacle; in it Miss Ridge
touches strange heights. It is essentially a poem of the city,
of its sodden brutalities, its sudden beauties. Swift figures
shine from these lines, like barbaric colors leaping out of
darkness; images that are surprising but never strained glow
with a condensed clarity. In her other poems—especially in
“The Song of Iron,” “Faces” and “Frank Little at Calvary”—the
same dignity is maintained, though with less magic.</p>

<p class='c015'><cite>Sun-Up</cite> (1920) is less integrated, more frankly experimental.
But the same vibrancy and restrained power that distinguished
her preceding book are manifest here. Her delineations
are sensitive and subtle; she accomplishes the maximum
in effects with a minimum of effort.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><i>Wallace Stevens</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Wallace Stevens, of Hartford, Connecticut, is a poet whose
peculiar quality is only exceeded by his reticence. He has
scrupulously kept out of the public eye, has printed his poetry
only at rare intervals and, though much of his work has been
highly praised, has steadfastly refused to publish a volume.</p>

<p class='c015'>Stevens’s best work may be found in the three <cite>Others</cite>
anthologies, edited by Alfred Kreymborg. Some of it is penetrative,
more than a little is puzzling and all of it is provocative.
In spite of what seems a weary disdain, Stevens is a more than
skilful decorator and, like T. S. Eliot, combines irony and
glamour in a highly original idiom.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'><i>Alfred Kreymborg</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Alfred Kreymborg, one of the most original of the younger
insurgents, was born in New York City, December 10, 1883.
His education was spasmodic, his childhood being spent beneath
the roar of the elevated trains. At ten he was an expert chess
player, devoting practically all his time to a study of the game.
Later, he became a bookkeeper for a few years, but from the
ages of seventeen to twenty-five he supported himself by
teaching chess and playing exhibition games. His passion,
however, was not mathematics but music. He dreamed of
extending the borders of poetry into the realms of tonic art,
experimented with new systems of notation, technicalities of
rhythm. At thirty, he began to turn to the theater as a medium;
finding, in this way, fresh contacts that enriched and ripened
his later work.</p>

<p class='c015'>In 1914, he organized that group of radical poets which,
half-deprecatingly, half-defiantly, called itself “Others.” (He
edited the three anthologies of their work published in 1916,
1917 and 1919.) Meanwhile, he had been working on a
technique that was a fresh attempt to rid poetry of its too
frequent wordiness and rhetorical non-essentials. <cite>Mushrooms</cite>
(1916) was the first collection in this vein. Here Kreymborg
continually sought for simplification, cutting away at his lines
until they assumed an almost naked expression. Often he
overdid his effects, attaining nothing more than a false ingenuousness,
a sophisticated simplicity. Often, too, he failed to
draw the line between what is innocently childlike and what
is merely childish. One sees him frequently trying to strike
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>curious attitudes, tripping over several of his buffooneries and
sprawling ingloriously.</p>

<p class='c015'>But Kreymborg, for all harlequin gestures, can do something
better than tumble and talk with his tongue in his cheek.
An elfin fantasy and no little beauty of thought are his when
he wants to use them. Surprising whimsicality and passages of
bright color distinguish his <cite>Plays for Poem-Mimes</cite> (1918), in
which the principles of modern art are applied to poetry and
acting, as well as the more developed <cite>Plays for Merry Andrews</cite>
(1920).</p>

<p class='c015'>Kreymborg’s most ambitious volume of poetry, <cite>Blood of
Things</cite> (1920), is, for all the surface oddities, the work not only
of an ardent experimenter but a serious thinker. Humor is in
these pages, but it is humor lifted to a sort of exaltation. Here,
in spite of what seems a persistence of occasional charlatanry, is
a rich and sensitive imagination; a fancy that is as wild as it
is quick-witted.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><i>Arthur Davison Ficke</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Arthur Davison Ficke was born at Davenport, Iowa, November
10, 1883. He received his A.B. at Harvard (1904),
studied for the law and was admitted to the bar in 1908. In
1919, after two years’ service in France, he gave up his law
practice and devoted himself to literature exclusively.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ficke is the author of ten volumes of verse, the most representative
of which are <cite>Sonnets of a Portrait Painter</cite> (1914),
<cite>The Man on the Hilltop</cite> (1915) and <cite>An April Elegy</cite> (1917).
In these, the author has distilled a warm spirituality, combining
freshness of vision with an intensified seriousness.</p>

<p class='c015'>Having been an expert collector and student of Japanese
prints, Ficke has written two books on this theme. His intellectual
equipment is reinforced by a strong sense of satire.
Writing under the pseudonym “Anne Knish,” he was one of
the co-authors (with Witter Bynner) of <cite>Spectra</cite> (1916), which,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>caricaturing some of the wilder outgrowths of the new poetry,
was taken seriously by a majority of the critics and proved to
be a brilliant hoax.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><i>Badger Clark</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Badger Clark was born at Albia, Iowa, in 1883. He moved
to Dakota Territory at the age of three months and now lives
in the Black Hills of South Dakota.</p>

<p class='c015'>Clark is one of the few men who have lived to see their
work become part of folk-lore; many of his songs having been
adapted and paraphrased by the cowboys who have made them
their own. A version of one of his poems (“The Glory
Trail”), after wide circulation among the ranchers and cow-punchers,
was printed as an example of anonymous folk-song
in <cite>Poetry; A Magazine of Verse</cite> under the title “High-Chin
Bob”—and credited to “Author Unknown.”</p>

<p class='c015'><cite>Sun and Saddle Leather</cite> (1915) and <cite>Grass-Grown Trails</cite>
(1917) are the expression of a native singer; happy, spontaneous
and seldom “literary.” There is wind in these songs;
the smell of camp-smoke and the colors of prairie sunsets rise
from them. Free, for the most part, from affectations, Clark
achieves an unusual ease in his use of the local vernacular.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><i>Harry Kemp</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Harry (Hibbard) Kemp, known as “the tramp-poet,” was
born at Youngstown, Ohio, December 15, 1883. He came East
at the age of twelve, left school to enter a factory, but returned
to high school to study English.</p>

<p class='c015'>A globe-trotter by nature, he went to sea before finishing his
high school course. He shipped first to Australia, then to
China, from China to California, from California to the University
of Kansas. After a few months in London in 1909 (he
crossed the Atlantic as a stowaway) he returned to New York
City, where he has lived ever since, founding his own theater
in which he is actor, stage-manager, playwright and chorus.</p>

<p class='c015'>Kemp’s first book was a play, <cite>Judas</cite> (1910), a reversion of
the biblical figure along the lines of Paul Heyse’s <cite>Mary of
Magdala</cite>. His first collection of poems, <cite>The Cry of Youth</cite>
(1914), like the subsequent volume, <cite>The Passing God</cite> (1919),
is full of every kind of poetry except the kind one might
imagine Kemp would write. Instead of crude and boisterous
verse, here is a precise and almost over-polished poetry. Kemp
has, strangely enough, taken the classic formalists for his
models—one can even detect the whispers of Pope and Dryden
in his lines.</p>

<p class='c015'><cite>Chanteys and Ballads</cite> (1920) is riper and more representative.
The notes are more varied, the sense of personality is
more pronounced.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><i>Max Eastman</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Max Eastman was born at Canandaigua, New York, January
4, 1883. Both his father and mother had been Congregationalist
preachers, so it was natural that the son should turn
from scholasticism to a definitely social expression. Eastman
had received his A.B. at Williams in 1905; from 1907 to 1911
he had been Associate in Philosophy at Columbia University.
But in the latter part of 1911, he devoted all his time to
writing, studying the vast problems of economic inequality and
voicing the protests of the dumb millions in a style that was
all the firmer for being philosophic. In 1913, he became editor
of <cite>The Masses</cite> which, in 1917, became <cite>The Liberator</cite>.</p>

<p class='c015'><cite>Child of the Amazons</cite> (1913) reveals the quiet lover of beauty
as well as the fiery hater of injustice. The best of these
poems, with many new ones, were incorporated in <cite>Colors of
Life</cite> (1918). This volume is a far richer collection; a record
of glowing hours, steadily burning truths.</p>

<p class='c015'>Besides Eastman’s poems and essays, he has written one of
the most clarifying—and most readable—studies of the period.
<cite>Enjoyment of Poetry</cite> (1913) is invaluable as a new kind of
text-book, the chief purpose of which, in the words of its
preface, is to increase enjoyment. Eliminating the usual academic
and literary classifications, Eastman accomplishes his
object, which is to show that the poetic in everyday perception
and conversation should not be separated from the poetic in
literature.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'><i>Arturo Giovannitti</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Arturo Giovannitti was born in Abruzzi, Italy, January 7,
1884. He studied at the college of his native province and
came to New York when he was eighteen years old. Even as
a child, Giovannitti had dreamed of America and had
“learned upon the knees of his mother and father to reverence,
with tears in his eyes, the name of the republic.” With the
dream of America as the great liberator in his heart, his first
impressions were shattering. What he saw, through the eyes
of the laborer, was the whiplash and legal trickery, the few
ruling the many, the miseries and exploitation of the helpless.
He thought of becoming a preacher, attended theological
school; sought a greater outlet for his passion for democracy
and became an editor; lectured, wrote pamphlets and worked
continually to express “a multitude of men lost in an immensity
of silence.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Although Giovannitti has written several books in Italian, his
one English volume is <cite>Arrows in the Gale</cite> (1914). In an eloquent
introduction to the poet’s rough music and rougher mixture
of realism and rapture, Helen Keller writes, “He makes us
feel the presence of toilers behind tenement walls, behind the
machinery they guide.... He finds voice for his message in
the sighs, the dumb hopes, the agonies and thwartings of men
who are bowed and broken by the monster hands of machines.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Several of Giovannitti’s poems are in rhyme, but his most
characteristic lines move in uplifted prose poems that shape
themselves vividly to their subjects. “The Cage,” with its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>restrained anger, and “The Walker” are typical. “The
Walker,” unfortunately too long to quote in its entirety, is
remarkable not only as an art-work but as a document; it is
a twentieth-century “Ballad of Reading Gaol,” with an intensity
and mystical power of which Wilde was incapable.</p>

      <div class='line'>I hear footsteps over my head all night.</div>
      <div class='line'>They come and they go. Again they come and they go all night.</div>
      <div class='line'>They come one eternity in four paces and they go one   eternity in four paces, and between the coming and the going there is Silence and the Night and the Infinite.</div>
      <div class='line'>For infinite are the nine feet of a prison cell, and endless is the march of him who walks between the yellow brick wall and the red iron gate, thinking things that cannot be chained and cannot be locked, but that wander far away in the sunlit world, each in a wild pilgrimage after a destined goal.</div>

      <div class='line'>One-two-three-four: four paces and the iron gate.</div>
      <div class='line'>He has measured his space, he has measured it accurately, scrupulously, minutely, as the hangman measures the rope and the gravedigger the coffin—so many feet,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>so many inches, so many fractions of an inch for each of the four paces.</div>
      <div class='line'>One-two-three-four. Each step sounds heavy and hollow over my head, and the echo of each step sounds hollow within my head as I count them in suspense and in dread that once, perhaps, in the endless walk, there may be five steps instead of four between the</div>
      <div class='line'>yellow brick wall and the red iron gate.</div>
      <div class='line'>But he has measured the space so accurately, so scrupulously, so minutely that nothing breaks the grave rhythm of the slow, fantastic march.</div>

      <div class='line'>But does he think? Why should he think? Do I think? I only hear the footsteps and count them. Four steps and the wall. Four steps and the gate. But beyond? Beyond? Where goes he beyond the gate and the wall?</div>
      <div class='line'>He goes not beyond. His thought breaks there on the iron gate. Perhaps it breaks like a wave of rage, perhaps like a sudden flow of hope, but it always returns to beat the wall like a billow of helplessness and despair.</div>
      <div class='line'>He walks to and fro within the narrow whirlpit of this ever storming and furious thought. Only one thought—constant, fixed, immovable, sinister, without power and without voice.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>A thought of madness, frenzy, agony and despair, a hell-brewed thought, for it is a natural thought. All things natural are things impossible while there are jails in the world—bread, work, happiness, peace, love.</div>
      <div class='line'>But he thinks not of this. As he walks he thinks of the most superhuman, the most unattainable, the most impossible thing in the world:</div>
      <div class='line'>He thinks of a small brass key that turns just half around and throws open the red iron gate.</div>

</div>

<p class='c018'>Eunice Tietjens (née Hammond) was born in Chicago,
Illinois, July 29, 1884. She married Paul Tietjens, the composer,
in 1904. During 1914 and 1916 she was Associate
Editor of <cite>Poetry; A Magazine of Verse</cite> and went to France as
war correspondent of the Chicago <cite>Daily News</cite> (1917-18). Her
second marriage (to Cloyd Head, the writer) occurred in
February, 1920.</p>

<p class='c015'><cite>Profiles from China</cite> (1917) is a series of sketches of people,
scenes and incidents observed in the interior. Written in a
fluent free verse, the poems in this collection are alive with
color and personality. The succeeding <cite>Body and Raiment</cite>
(1919) is less integrated, more derivative and diffuse. And
yet, in spite of certain obvious echoes, individual poems like
“The Drug Clerk,” “The Steam Shovel” and a few others
are worthy to stand beside her distinguished first volume.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'><i>Sara Teasdale</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Sara Teasdale was born August 8, 1884, at St. Louis, Missouri,
and educated there. After leaving school, she traveled in
Europe and the Near East. In 1914, she married Ernst B.
Filsinger, who has written several books on foreign trade, and
moved to New York City in 1916.</p>

<p class='c015'>Her first book was a slight volume, <cite>Sonnets to Duse</cite> (1907),
giving little promise of the rich lyricism which was to follow.
<cite>Helen of Troy and Other Poems</cite> (1911) contains the first hints
of that delicate craftsmanship and authentic loveliness which
this poet has brought to such a high pitch. The six monologues
which open the volume are splendid delineations written in a
blank verse that is as musical as many of her lyrics. At times
it suffers from too conscious a cleverness; the dexterity with
which Miss Teasdale turns a phrase or twists her last line is
frequently too obtrusive to be wholly enjoyable.</p>

<p class='c015'><cite>Rivers to the Sea</cite> (1915) emphasizes this epigrammatic skill,
but a greater restraint is here, a warmer spontaneity. The
new collection contains at least a dozen unforgettable snatches,
lyrics in which the words seem to fall into place without art
or effort. Seldom employing metaphor or striking imagery,
almost bare of ornament, these poems have the sheer magic of
triumphant song. Theirs is an artlessness that is more than
an art.</p>

<p class='c015'><cite>Love Songs</cite> (1917) is a collection of Miss Teasdale’s previous
melodies for the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">viola d’amore</span></i> together with several new tunes.
The new poems emphasize the way in which this poet achieves
a direct enchantment without verbal subtleties. They also emphasize
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>their superiority to the earlier love lyrics that were
written in a mood of literary romance, of artificial moonlit
roses, languishing lutes, balconies, passionate guitars—a mood
that was not so much erotic as Pierrotic.</p>

<p class='c015'><cite>Flame and Shadow</cite> (1920) is by far the best of her books.
Here the beauty is fuller and deeper; an almost mystic radiance
plays from these starry verses. Technically, also, this
volume marks Miss Teasdale’s greatest advance. The words
are chosen with a keener sense of their actual as well as their
musical values; the rhythms are much more subtle and varied;
the line moves with a greater naturalness. Beneath the symbolism
of poems like “Water Lilies” and “The Long Hill,”
one is conscious of a finer artistry, a more flexible speech that
is all the lovelier for its slight (and logical) irregularities.</p>

<p class='c015'>Besides her own books, Miss Teasdale has compiled an
anthology, <cite>The Answering Voice</cite> (1917), comprising one hundred
love lyrics by women.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><i>Gladys Cromwell</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Gladys Cromwell was born November 28, 1885, in New
York City. She was educated in New York private schools
and lived abroad a great deal. “Her life,” writes Anne
Dunn, “was little indented by outer events, being wholly of
the mind and spirit.” She was most at home in the world
within herself, sensitive and—to the final, tragic degree—self-effacing.</p>

<p class='c015'>In January, 1918, Gladys and Dorothea, her twin-sister,
enrolled in the Canteen Service of the Red Cross, sailed for
France and were stationed at Châlons. Both girls worked
unremittingly for eight months. It was only at the end of
their desperate labors that they gave way to hopelessness,
believing their efforts futile and the whole world desolate.
Signs of a mental breakdown show in their diaries as early
as October. “After the armistice,” writes Anne Dunn in her
biographical note which serves as an appreciative epilogue to
Gladys Cromwell’s <cite>Poems</cite>, “they showed symptoms of nervous
prostration; but years of self-control and consideration for
others made them conceal the black horror in which they lived,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>the agony through which they saw a world which, they felt,
contained no refuge for beauty or quiet thought. And when,
on their way home, they jumped from the deck of the <cite>Lorraine</cite>
it was in response to a vision that promised them fulfilment
and peace.” After their death, which occurred January
19, 1919, the French Government awarded the two sisters the
Croix de Guerre.</p>

<p class='c015'><cite>Gates of Utterance</cite> (1915) has something more than the usual
“promise.” But the best of Miss Cromwell’s work can be
found in her posthumously published <cite>Poems</cite> (1919), which, in
1920, received the yearly prize offered by the Poetry Society of
America, dividing the honor with Neihardt’s <cite>The Song of
Three Friends</cite>. Her most significant poems betray that attitude
to life which was at the heart of her tragedy—a preoccupation
that was a mixture of fascination and fear. Her lines, never
mediocre, are introspective and fraught with serious concern—the
work of a frailer and unsmiling Emily Dickinson. Several
of the best of her delicate songs, like the two lyrics quoted,
tremble on the verge of greatness.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'><i>Ezra Pound</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Ezra (Loomis) Pound was born at Hailey, Idaho, October 30,
1885; attended Hamilton College and the University of Pennsylvania;
and went abroad, seeking fresh material to complete
a thesis on Lope de Vega, in 1908. After visiting Spain on
a roundabout journey to England, where he took up his residence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>and where he has lived ever since, Pound halted for
a while in Italy. It was there, in Venice, to be precise, that
Pound’s first book, <cite>A Lume Spento</cite> (1908), was printed. The
following year Pound went to London and the chief poems of
the little volume were incorporated in <cite>Personæ</cite> (1909), a small
collection containing some of Pound’s finest work.</p>

<p class='c015'>Although the young American was a total stranger to the
English literary world, his book made a definite impression on
critics of all shades and tastes. Edward Thomas, one of the
most careful appraisers, wrote “the beauty of it is the beauty
of passion, sincerity and intensity, not of beautiful words and
images and suggestions.... The thought dominates the
words and is greater than they are.” Another critic (Scott
James) placed the chief emphasis on Pound’s metrical innovations,
saying, “At first the whole thing may seem to be
mere madness and rhetoric, a vain exhibition of force and
passion without beauty. But as we read on, these curious
meters seem to have a law and order of their own.”</p>

<p class='c015'><cite>Exultations</cite> (1909) was printed in the autumn of the same
year that saw the appearance of <cite>Personæ</cite>. It was received with
even greater cordiality; a new force and freedom were manifest
in such poems as “Sestina: Altaforte,” “Ballad of the
Goodly Fere,” “Francesca” and “Histrion.”</p>

<p class='c015'>In both of these books there was evident Pound’s erudition—a
familiarity with mediæval literature, Provençal singers,
Troubadour ballads—that, later on, was to degenerate into
pedantry and become hard and dry. Too often in his later
work, Pound seems to be more the archaeologist than the artist,
digging with little energy and less enthusiasm. <cite>Canzoni</cite> (1911)
and <cite>Ripostes</cite> (1912) both contain much that is sharp and living;
they also contain the germs of desiccation and decay.
Pound began to scatter his talents; to start movements which
he quickly discarded for new ones; to spend himself in poetic
propaganda for the Imagists and others (see Preface); to give
more and more time to translation (<cite>The Sonnets of Guido
Cavalcanti</cite> appeared in 1912) and arrangements from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>Chinese (<cite>Cathay</cite>, paraphrased from the notes of Ernest
Fenollosa, was issued in 1915); to lay the chief stress on
<i>technique</i>, shades of color, verbal <i>nuances</i>. The result was a
lassitude of the creative faculties, an impoverishment of emotion.
In the later books, Pound begins to suffer from a
decadence which appraises the values in life chiefly as æsthetic
values. And this decadence expresses itself in a weariness, a
sterility of the imagination. Real feeling becomes rarer in his
work and the poet descends to flashy trivialities, vagaries of
assertion or sheer <i>bravado</i> of expression—wasting much of his
gift in a mere tilting at convention.</p>

<p class='c015'>But though this is true of a great quantity of his recent work,
though he often seems a living anachronism, drawing life not
from life itself but only from books, many of the poems in
<cite>Lustra</cite> (1917) yield a hard brightness. The influence of
Browning and the pre-Raphaelites is less pronounced and reflections
of his earlier energy stand out with a peculiar brilliance.</p>

<p class='c015'>Too special to achieve permanence, too intellectual to become
popular, Pound’s contribution to his age should not be underestimated.
He was a pioneer in the new forms; he fought
dullness wherever he encountered it; under his leadership the
Imagists became not only a group but a protest; he helped to
make many of the paths which a score of unconsciously influenced
poets tread with such ease and nonchalance. Much of
his poetry gesticulates instead of speaking, a great portion of
his art is poetry in pantomime. And yet, without Pound,
American poetry would scarcely have been the many-voiced,
multi-colored thing that it is.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'><i>Louis Untermeyer</i></h2>
</div>
<p class='c018'>Louis Untermeyer was born October 1, 1885, in New York
City, where he has lived, except for brief sojourns in Maine
and New Jersey, ever since. His education was sketchy; his
continued failure to comprehend algebra and geometry kept
him from entering college. His one ambition was to become
a composer. At sixteen he appeared as a pianist in semi-professional
circles; at seventeen he entered his father’s
jewelry manufacturing establishment, of which he became designer
and factory manager.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>Untermeyer’s first volume was <cite>The Younger Quire</cite> (1911), a
twenty-four-page burlesque of an anthology (<cite>The Younger
Choir</cite>). It was issued anonymously and only one hundred
copies were printed. Later in the same year, he published a
sequence of some seventy lyrics entitled <cite>First Love</cite> (1911) in
which the influences of Heine, Henley and Housman were not
only obvious but crippling. With the exception of about eight
of these songs, the volume is devoid of character and, in spite
of a certain technical facility, wholly undistinguished.</p>

<p class='c015'>It was with <cite>Challenge</cite> (1914), now in its fourth edition, that
the author first spoke in his own idiom. Although the ghost
of Henley still haunts some of these pages, poems like “Summons,”
“Landscapes” and “Caliban in the Coal Mines”
show “a fresh and lyrical sympathy with the modern world....
His vision” (thus the Boston <cite>Transcript</cite>) “is a social
vision, his spirit a passionately energized command of the
forces of justice.”</p>

<p class='c015'><cite>Challenge</cite> was succeeded by <cite>These Times</cite> (1917), evidently
an “interval” book which, lacking the concentration and unity
of the better known collection, sought (not always successfully)
for larger horizons. Certain poems (like “Swimmers,” “The
Laughers” and the colloquial sonnets) stand out, but as a
whole it has neither the energy of his earlier nor the surety of
his later work. <cite>The New Adam</cite> (1920) is a more satisfactory
unit; here the varied passions are fused in a new heat.</p>

<p class='c015'>Besides this serious poetry, Untermeyer has published two
volumes of critical parodies, “<i>—— and Other Poets</i>” (1917)
and <cite>Including Horace</cite> (1919)—paraphrases of the Latin bard
as various classic and modern poets might have rendered him.
He has also printed a strict metrical translation of three hundred
and twenty-five <cite>Poems of Heinrich Heine</cite> (1917); a volume
of prose criticism, <cite>The New Era in American Poetry</cite>
(1919); and two text-books. He was one of the Associate
Editors of <cite>The Seven Arts</cite> (1916-17) and has lectured at
various universities in the Eastern States.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>
  <h2 class='c005'><i>Jean Starr Untermeyer</i></h2>
</div>
<p class='c018'>Jean Starr was born at Zanesville, Ohio, May 13, 1886, and
educated at the Putnam Seminary in the city of her birth. At
sixteen, she came to New York City, pursuing special studies at
Columbia. In 1907 she married Louis Untermeyer and, although
she had written some prose previous to the poetic
renascence, her first volume was published more than ten years
later.</p>

<p class='c015'><cite>Growing Pains</cite> (1918) is a thin book of thirty-four poems,
the result of eight years slow and self-critical creation. This
careful and highly selective process does much to bring the
volume up to an unusually high level; a severity of taste and
standards maintain the poet on the same austere plane. Perfection
is almost a passion with her; the first poem in the book
declares:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c021'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I would rather work in stubborn rock</div>
      <div class='line'>All the years of my life;</div>
      <div class='line'>And make one strong thing</div>
      <div class='line'>And set it in a high, clean place,</div>
      <div class='line'>To recall the granite strength of my desire.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Acutely self-analytical, there is a stern, uncompromising relentlessness
toward her introspections that keeps them from
being wistful or pathetic. These poems are, as she explains in
her title-poem—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c021'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>No songs for an idle lute,</div>
      <div class='line'>No pretty tunes of coddled ills,</div>
      <div class='line'>But the bare chart of my growing pains.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Intellect is always in the ascendency, even in the most
ecstatic verses. In an almost religious poem, “A Man” (dedicated
to her father), she pictures herself as a child, and
expresses the whole psychology of our juvenile love of poor
literature in lines like:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c021'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>A book held gaping on my knees,</div>
      <div class='line'>Watering a sterile romance with my thoughts.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>But it is not only her keen search for truth and an equally
keen eye for the exact word that make these poems distinctive.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>A sharp color sense, a surprising whimsicality, a translation of
the ordinary in terms of the beautiful, illumine such poems as
“Sinfonia Domestica,” “Clothes,” “Autumn.” In the last
named, with its brilliant combination of painting and housewifery,
Mrs. Untermeyer has reproduced her early environment
with a bright pungency; “Verhaeren’s Flemish <i>genre</i> pictures
are no better,” writes Amy Lowell. Several of her purely
pictorial poems establish a swift kinship between the most
romantic and most prosaic objects. The tiny “Moonrise” is
an example; so is “High Tide,” that, in one extended metaphor,
turns the mere fact of a physical law into a most arresting
and noble fancy.</p>

<p class='c015'><cite>Dreams Out of Darkness</cite> (1921) is a ripening of this author’s
powers with a richer musical undercurrent. This increase of
melody is manifest on every page, possibly most striking in
“Lake Song,” which, beneath its symbolism, is one of the most
liquid unrhymed lyrics of the period.</p>

      <div class='line'>Sprang—but were drawn back slowly</div>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'><i>John Gould Fletcher</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>John Gould Fletcher was born at Little Rock, Arkansas,
January 3, 1886. He was educated at Phillips Academy
(Andover, Massachusetts) and Harvard (1903-7) and, after
spending several years in Massachusetts, moved to England,
where, except for brief visits to the United States, he has lived
ever since.</p>

<p class='c015'>In 1913, Fletcher published five tiny books of poems which
he has referred to as “his literary wild oats,” five small collections
of experimental and faintly interesting verse. Two years
later, Fletcher appeared as a decidedly less conservative and
far more arresting poet with <cite>Irradiations—Sand and Spray</cite>
(1915). This volume is full of an extraordinary fancy;
imagination riots through it, even though it is often a bloodless
and bodiless imagination. It is crowded—even overcrowded—with
æsthetic subtleties, a sort of brilliant and haphazard series
of improvisations.</p>

<p class='c015'>In the following book, <cite>Goblins and Pagodas</cite> (1916), Fletcher
carries his unrelated harmonies much further. Color dominates
him; the ambitious set of eleven “color symphonies” is an
elaborate design in which the tone as well as the thought is
summoned by color-associations, sometimes closely related,
sometimes far-fetched, “It contains,” says Conrad Aiken in
his appreciative chapter on Fletcher in <cite>Scepticisms</cite>, “little of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>the emotion which relates to the daily life of men and women....
It is a sort of absolute poetry, a poetry of detached
waver and brilliance, a beautiful flowering of language alone—a
parthenogenesis, as if language were fertilized by itself
rather than by thought or feeling. Remove the magic of
phrase and sound and there is nothing left: no thread of continuity,
no thought, no story, no emotion. But the magic of
phrase and sound is powerful, and it takes one into a fantastic
world.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Meanwhile, Fletcher has been developing. After having appeared
in the three Imagist anthologies, he sought for depths
rather than surfaces. Beginning with his majestic “Lincoln,”
his work has had a closer relation to humanity; a moving
mysticism speaks from <cite>The Tree of Life</cite> (1918), the more
obviously native <cite>Granite and Breakers</cite> (1921) and the later
uncollected poems. Although the unconscious too often dictates
Fletcher’s fantasies, a calm music dominates his shorter poems, a
grave and subdued lyricism moves and enriches them.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>“<i>H. D.</i>”</h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Hilda Doolittle was born September 10, 1886, at Bethlehem,
Pennsylvania. When she was still a child, her father became
Director of the Flower Observatory and the family moved to
a suburb in the outskirts of Philadelphia. Hilda Doolittle attended
a private school in West Philadelphia; entered Bryn
Mawr College in 1904; and went abroad, for what was intended
to be a short sojourn, in 1911. After a visit to Italy
and France, she came to London, joining Ezra Pound and
helping to organize the Imagists. Her work (signed “H. D.”)
began to appear in a few magazines and its unusual quality
was recognized at once. She married one of the most talented
of the English members of this group (Richard Aldington) in
1913 and remained in London, creating, through a chiseled
verse, her pure and flawless reproductions of Greek poetry and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>sculpture. In 1920, she made her long-deferred visit to America,
settling on the Californian coast, returning, the following
year, to England.</p>

<p class='c015'>“H. D.” is, by all odds, the most important of her group.
She is the only one who has steadfastly held to the letter as
well as the spirit of its <i>credo</i>. She is, in fact, the only true
Imagist. Her poems, capturing the firm delicacy of the Greek
models, are like a set of Tanagra figurines. Here, at first
glance, the effect is chilling—beauty seems held in a frozen
gesture. But it is in this very fixation of light, color and emotion
that she achieves intensity. What, at first, seemed static
becomes fluent; the arrested moment glows with brimming
energy.</p>

<p class='c015'>Observe the poem entitled “Heat.” Here, in the fewest
possible words, is something beyond the description of heat—here
is the effect of it. In these lines one feels the very weight
and solidity of a midsummer afternoon.</p>

<p class='c015'>Her efforts to draw the contemporary world are less happy.
She is best in her reflections of clear-cut loveliness in a quietly
pagan world. Her art, in its precision and polish, is curiously
Hellenic; “H. D.,” in most of her moods, seems less of a contemporary
than an inspired anachronism.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><i>William Rose Benét</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>William Rose Benét was born at Fort Hamilton, New York
Harbor, February 2, 1886. He was educated at Albany Academy
and graduated from Yale in 1907. After various experiences
as free-lance writer, publisher’s reader, magazine editor
and second lieutenant in the U. S. Air Service, Benét became
the Associate Editor of the New York Post’s <cite>Literary Review</cite> in
1920.</p>

<p class='c015'>The outstanding feature of Benét’s verse is its extraordinary
whimsicality; an oriental imagination riots through his pages.
Like the title-poem of his first volume, <cite>Merchants from Cathay</cite>
(1913), all of Benét’s volumes vibrate with a vigorous music;
they are full of the sonorous stuff that one rolls out crossing
wintry fields or tramping a road alone.</p>

<p class='c015'>But Benét’s charm is not confined to the lift and swing of
rollicking choruses. His <cite>The Falconer of God</cite> (1914), <cite>The
Great White Wall</cite> (1916) and <cite>The Burglar of the Zodiac</cite>
(1918) contain decorations as bold as they are brilliant; they
ring with a strange and spicy music evoked from seemingly
casual words; they glow with a half-lurid, half-humorous
reflection of the grotesque. There are times when Benét seems
to be forcing his ingenuity. The poet frequently lets his fantastic
Pegasus run away with him, and what started out to be
a gallop among the stars ends in a scraping of shins on the
pavement. But he is saved by an acrobatic dexterity even when
his energy betrays him.</p>

<p class='c015'><cite>Moons of Grandeur</cite> (1920) represents the fullest development
of Benét’s unusual gifts; a combination of Eastern phantasy and
Western vigor.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'><i>John Hall Wheelock</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>John Hall Wheelock was born at Far Rockaway, Long Island,
in 1886. He was graduated from Harvard, receiving his
B.A. in 1908, and finished his studies at the Universities of
Göttingen and Berlin, 1908-10.</p>

<p class='c015'>Wheelock’s first book is, in many respects, his best. <cite>The
Human Fantasy</cite> (1911) sings with the voice of youth—a youth
which is vibrantly, even vociferously, in love with existence.
Rhapsodic and obviously influenced by Whitman and Henley,
these lines beat bravely; a singing buoyance arrests one upon
opening the volume. A headlong ecstasy rises from pages
whose refrain is “Splendid it is to live and glorious to die.”
<cite>The Beloved Adventure</cite> (1912) is less powerful but scarcely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>less passionate. Lyric after lyric moves one by its athletic
music and spiritual intensity.</p>

<p class='c015'>Wheelock’s subsequent volumes are less individualized. <cite>Love
and Liberation</cite> (1913) and <cite>Dust and Light</cite> (1919) are long dilutions
of the earlier strain. The music is still here, but most
of the magic has gone. Wheelock has allowed himself to be
exploited by his own fluency, and the result is unbelievably
monotonous. Yet even vast stretches of two hundred and thirty
unvaried love songs cannot bury a dozen or more vivid poems
which lie, half-concealed, in a waste of verbiage.</p>

<p class='c015'>In spite of his lapses and lack of selective taste, Wheelock
is often a stirring lyricist. <cite>The Human Fantasy</cite> is one of the
most remarkable “first” books of the period.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'><i>Joyce Kilmer</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>(Alfred) Joyce Kilmer was born at New Brunswick, New
Jersey, December 6, 1886. He was graduated from Rutgers
College in 1904 and received his A.B. from Columbia in 1906.
After leaving Columbia he became, in rapid succession, instructor
of Latin at Morristown High School, editor of a
journal for horsemen, book salesman, book-reviewer, lexicographer,
æsthete, interviewer, socialist and churchman.</p>

<p class='c015'>After Kilmer became converted to Catholicism, his conception
of the church was the Church Militant. “His thought,”
writes his biographer, Robert Cortes Holliday, “dwelt continually
on warrior-saints.... As he saw it, there was no
question as to his duty.” In 1917 Kilmer joined the Officers’
Reserve Training Corps, but he soon resigned from this. In
less than three weeks after America entered the world war,
he enlisted as a private in the Seventh Regiment, National
Guard, New York. Shortly before the regiment left New York
for Spartanburg, South Carolina, Kilmer was transferred at his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>own request to the 165th Infantry. In spite of his avowed
militancy, Kilmer was “a poet trying to be a soldier;” he
made no effort to glorify war; his one hope was to wring some
spiritual satisfaction out of the brutality.</p>

<p class='c015'>On July 28, 1918, the five-day battle for the mastery of the
heights beyond the river Ourcq was begun. Two days later,
Sergeant Kilmer was killed in action.</p>

<p class='c015'>Death came before the poet had developed or even matured
his gifts. His first volume, <cite>Summer of Love</cite> (1911), is
wholly imitative; it is full of reflections of a dozen other
sources, “a broken bundle of mirrors.” <cite>Trees and Other Poems</cite>
(1914) contains the title-poem by which Kilmer is best known
and, though various influences are still strong (one cannot miss
the borrowed accents of Patmore, Belloc, Chesterton, Housman
and—<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vide</span></i> “Martin”—E. A. Robinson), a refreshing candor
lights up the lines. <cite>Main Street and Other Poems</cite> (1917) is
less derivative; the simplicity is less self-conscious, the ecstasy
more spontaneous.</p>

<p class='c015'>Besides his own poetry, Kilmer edited a selection of <cite>Verses</cite>
by Hilaire Belloc (1916) and <cite>Dreams and Images</cite>, An Anthology
of Catholic poets (1917).</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>Shaemas O Sheel (Shields) was born September 19, 1886, in
New York City. After graduating from high school, he revived
the ancient Gaelic form of his family name and identified
himself with the cause of Ireland in America.</p>

<p class='c015'>O Sheel’s two volumes, <cite>The Blossomy Bough</cite> (1911) and
<cite>The Light Feet of Goats</cite> (1915), owe their chief impetus to the
Celtic renascence and to W. B. Yeats in particular. But
O Sheel’s poetry, although influenced, is not merely derivative.
His ancestry speaks through him with unmistakable accents;
he is typically the Irish bard of whom Chesterton has written:</p>

muffled heroism individualize the best of his work.</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>Roy Helton was born at Washington, D. C., in 1886. He
graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1908. He
studied art—and found he was color-blind. He spent two years
at inventions—and found he had no business sense. After a
few more experiments, he became a schoolmaster in West
Philadelphia.</p>

<p class='c015'>Helton’s first volume, <cite>Youth’s Pilgrimage</cite> (1915), is a strange,
mystical affair, full of vague symbolism with a few purple
patches. <cite>Outcasts in Beulah Land</cite> (1918) is entirely different
in theme and treatment. This is a much starker verse; a poetry
of city streets, direct and sharp.</p>

schooled himself to be an advertising copy writer, his creative
work being kept as an avocation.</p>

<p class='c015'><cite>Asphalt and Other Poems</cite> (1917) is a queer mixture. Cheap
stanzas crowd against lines of singular beauty; poor dialect
verse elbows lyrics that sing without a false note. The same
incongruity is evident in <cite>Black Branches</cite> (1920), where much
that is strained and artificial mingles with poetry that is not
only spontaneous but searching. At his best, notably in the
refreshing “Country Rhymes,” Johns is a true singer, a
lyricist of no little stature.</p>

<p class='c018'>Margaret Widdemer was born at Doylestown, Pennsylvania,
and began writing in her childhood. After graduating from
Drexel Institute Library School in 1909, she became a contributor
of poems and short stories to various magazines—her
first published poem (“The Factories”) being widely quoted.
She married Robert Haven Schauffler, the author, in August,
1919.</p>

<p class='c015'>Miss Widdemer’s poetic work has two distinct phases. In
the one mood, she is the protesting poet, the champion of the
down-trodden, the lyricist on fire with angry passion. In the
other, she is the writer of well-made, polite and popular
sentimental verse. Her finest poems are in <cite>Factories with Other
Lyrics</cite> (1915), although several of her best songs are in <cite>The
Old Road to Paradise</cite> (1918), which divided, with Sandburg’s
<cite>Cornhuskers</cite>, the Columbia Poetry Prize in 1918.</p>

<p class='c015'>Miss Widdemer is also the author of two books of short
stories, four novels and several books for girls.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><i>Alan Seeger</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Alan Seeger was born in New York, June 22, 1888. When
he was still a baby, his parents moved to Staten Island, where
he remained through boyhood. Later, there were several other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>migrations, including a sojourn in Mexico, where Seeger spent
the most impressionable years of his youth. In 1906, he entered
Harvard; became one of the editors of the <cite>Harvard Monthly</cite>;
returned to New York in 1910 and in 1913 set off for Paris—“a
departing point,” wrote William Archer, “which may
fairly be called his Hegira, the turning point of his history.”
1914 came, and the European war had not entered its third
week when, along with some forty of his fellow-countrymen,
Seeger enlisted in the Foreign Legion of France. He was in
action almost continually, serving on various fronts. On July 1,
1916, a new advance began; a few days later the Legion was
ordered to clear the Germans out of the village of Belloy-en-Santerre.
On the fourth of July, Seeger advanced in the first
rush and his squad was practically wiped out by hidden

next morning.</p>

<p class='c015'>Seeger’s literary promise was far greater than his poetic
accomplishment. With the exception of his one famous poem,
there is little of importance though much of charm in his
collected <cite>Poems</cite> (published, with an Introduction by William
Archer, in 1916). His letters from the front (published in
1917) show a more powerful touch, a keener sense of perception.
Had he lived a few years more, he might have been
a valuable recorder of a changed and changing world.</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>Willard (Austin) Wattles was born at Bayneville, Kansas,
July 8, 1888. He received his A.B. at the University of Kansas
in 1909 and, since 1910, has divided his time between teaching
English and harvesting wheat.</p>

<p class='c015'>His first book was an anthology, <cite>Sunflowers: A Book of
Kansas Poems</cite> (1914), to which he also contributed. <cite>Lanterns
in Gethsemane</cite> (1918) consists, almost entirely, of mystical and
religious poems. There is, however, little of the sermonizing
unction and less cant in these fresh pages. There is an unusual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>vibrancy here; a warm buoyance that glows against its theological
background. Many of Wattles’s verses have the
peculiar grace of a parable joined to a nursery rhyme; “The
Builder,” “Jericho” and a few others seem like scraps of the
Scripture rendered by Mother Goose.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><i>T. S. Eliot</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Thomas Stearns Eliot, one of the most brilliant of the young
expatriates, was born at St. Louis, Missouri, in 1888. He
received his A.B. at Harvard in 1909 and his A.M. in 1910.
Subsequently, he studied at the Sorbonne and at Merton College,
Oxford, becoming a teacher and lecturer in London, where he
has lived since 1913.</p>

<p class='c015'><cite>Prufrock</cite> appeared in England in 1917. An American edition,
including a number of other verses, was published under the
title <cite>Poems</cite> in 1920. Eliot’s early work is the more important;
it is curious and sharply original. The exaltation which is the
very breath of poetry is seldom present in Eliot’s later lines.
A certain perverse brilliance takes its place, an unearthly light
without warmth which has the sparkle if not the strength of fire.
It flickers mockingly through most of Eliot’s sardonic pictures
and shines with a bright pallor out of “The Love Song of J.
Alfred Prufrock” and “Portrait of a Lady.” These two long
poems are the book’s main exhibit; they are sensitive and
psychologically probing.</p>

<p class='c015'>Eliot’s ironic rhymed verses, which constitute the bulk of his
work, are in his later style. It is this vein that tempts Eliot
most—and is his own undoing. For irony, no matter how agile
and erudite—and Eliot’s is both—must contain heat if it is to
burn. And heat is one of the few things that cannot be juggled
by this acrobatic satirist. His lines, for the most part, are a
species of mordant light verse; complex and disillusioned <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vers

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'><i>Conrad Aiken</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Conrad (Potter) Aiken was born at Savannah, Georgia,
August 5, 1889. He attended Harvard, receiving his A.B. in
1912, travelled extensively for three years, and since then, he
has devoted all his time to literature, living at South Yarmouth,
Massachusetts.</p>

<p class='c015'>The most outstanding feature of Aiken’s creative work is its
rapid adaptability and its slow growth. His first volume,
<cite>Earth Triumphant and Other Tales in Verse</cite> (1914), is the
Keats tradition crossed, paraphrased (and vulgarized) by
Masefield. <cite>Turns and Movies</cite> (1916) is a complete change;
Masefield is exchanged for Masters. But in the less conspicuous
half of this book, Aiken begins to speak with his true voice.
Here he is the natural musician, playing with new rhythms,
haunting cadences. <cite>The Jig of Forslin</cite> (1916) is an elaboration
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>of his method. In this volume, Aiken goes back to the narrative—or
rather, to a series of loosely connected stories—and,
reinforced by studies in analytical psychology, explores “the
process of vicarious wish fulfilment by which civilized man
enriches his circumscribed life.”</p>

<p class='c015'><cite>Nocturne of Remembered Spring</cite> (1917), <cite>The Charnel Rose</cite>
(1918) and <cite>The House of Dust</cite> (1920) are packed with a tired
but often beautiful music. Even though much of it is enlivened
by injections of T. S. Eliot’s conversational idiom, the effect
is often moony and monotonous. Rain seems to fall persistently
through these volumes; dust blows down the street, the shadows
blur; everything dissolves in a mist of boredom and forgetfulness.
Even the poignance seems on the point of falling asleep.</p>

<p class='c015'>Often Aiken loses himself in this watery welter of language.
In trying to create a closer <i>liaison</i> between poetry and
music, he gives, too frequently, so much importance to the
rise and fall of syllables that his very excess of music defeats
his purpose. His verse, thus, gains greatly on the sensuous side
but loses, in its cloying indefiniteness, that vitality and sharpness
of speech which is the very blood of poetry.</p>

<p class='c015'>This weakening overinsistence on sound does not prevent
Aiken from attaining many exquisite effects. Primarily, a
lyric poet, he frequently condenses an emotion in a few lines;
some of his best moments are these “lapses” into tune. The
music of the Morning Song from “Senlin” (in <cite>The Charnel
Rose</cite>) is rich with subtleties of rhythm. But it is much more
than a lyrical movement. Beneath the flow and flexibility of
these lines, there is a delightful whimsicality, an extraordinary
summoning of the immensities that loom behind the casual moments
of everyday. And in “The Fulfilled Dream,” Aiken can
divert the stream of the subconscious, whose vague outlines he
reproduces so well, to show the dream in its vivid strength.</p>

<p class='c015'>Besides his varied poetry, Aiken has written a quantity of
criticism of contemporary poets, the best of his reviews having
been published in <cite>Scepticisms</cite> (1919), a provocative and valuable
series of studies.</p>

      <div class='line'>Looking about him calmly, watching the world,</div>
      <div class='line'>Taking his ease.... Yet, when he thought again</div>
      <div class='line'>Of the same dream, now dreamed three separate times,</div>
      <div class='line'>Always the same, and heard that whistling wind,</div>
      <div class='line'>And saw the windows flashing upward past him,—</div>
      <div class='line'>He slowed his pace a little, and thought with horror</div>
      <div class='line'>How monstrously that small tree thrust to meet him!...</div>
      <div class='line'>He slowed his pace a little and remembered his wife.</div>

      <div class='line'>But dreams had meanings.</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>He walked more slowly, and looked along the roofs,</div>

      <div class='line'>It seemed to whirl and swim,</div>

      <div class='line'>He lowered his eyes to the stones, he walked more slowly;</div>
      <div class='line'>His thoughts were blown and scattered like leaves;</div>
      <div class='line'>He thought of the pail.... Why, then, was it forgotten?</div>
      <div class='line'>Because he would not need it?</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Then, just as he was grouping his thoughts again</div>
      <div class='line'>About that drug-store corner, under an arc-lamp,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where first he met the girl whom he would marry,—</div>
      <div class='line'>That blue-eyed innocent girl, in a soft blouse,—</div>
      <div class='line'>He waved his hand for signal, and up he went</div>

      <div class='line'>Above the flattening roofs, until the sea</div>
      <div class='line'>Lay wide and waved before him.... And then he stepped</div>
      <div class='line'>Giddily out, from that security,</div>
      <div class='line'>To the red rib of iron against the sky,</div>
      <div class='line'>And walked along it, feeling it sing and tremble;</div>
      <div class='line'>And looking down one instant, saw the tree</div>
      <div class='line'>Just as he dreamed it was; and looked away,</div>
      <div class='line'>And up again, feeling his blood go wild.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>—He gave the signal; the long girder swung</div>
      <div class='line'>Closer upon him, dropped clanging into place,</div>

      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>Were tossed from below and deftly caught in pails;</div>
      <div class='line'>He signalled again, and wiped his mouth, and thought</div>
      <div class='line'>A place so high in the air should be more quiet.</div>
      <div class='line'>The tree, far down below, teased at his eyes,</div>
      <div class='line'>Teased at the corners of them, until he looked,</div>
      <div class='line'>And felt his body go suddenly small and light;</div>
      <div class='line'>Felt his brain float off like a dwindling vapor;</div>

  <h2 class='c005'><i>Christopher Morley</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Christopher (Darlington) Morley was born at Haverford,
Pennsylvania, May 5, 1890. He graduated from Haverford
College in 1910 and was Rhodes Scholar at New College, Oxford,
England, 1910-13.</p>

<p class='c015'>Since 1914 he has been on the staff of various periodicals,
coming to New York in 1920 to run his column (“The Bowling
Green”) on the New York <cite>Evening Post</cite>.</p>

<p class='c015'>Morley is the author of ten dissimilar volumes of essays,
skits, gossip, travel-notes, light verse and serious poetry. <cite>The
Rocking Horse</cite> (1919) and <cite>Hide and Seek</cite> (1920) sink too often
in their own sentiment; their sweetness is frequently cloying,
their charm a little too conscious. But Morley’s vigor energizes
his lines and prevents his verses—especially those in the latter
volume—from becoming tawdry with oversweetness.</p>

When he was five years old, he moved to California,

  <h2 class='c005'><i>Maxwell Bodenheim</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Maxwell Bodenheim was born at Natchez, Mississippi, May
26, 1892. His education, with the exception of grammar school
training, was achieved under the guidance of the U. S. Army, in
which Bodenheim served a full enlistment of three years, beginning
in 1910. For a while he studied law and art in
Chicago, but his mind, fascinated by the new poetry, turned to
literature. He wrote steadily for five years without having
a single poem accepted. In 1918, his first volume appeared and
even those who were puzzled or repelled by Bodenheim’s
complex idiom were forced to recognize its intense individuality.</p>

<p class='c015'><cite>Minna and Myself</cite> (1918) reveals, first of all, this poet’s
extreme sensitivity to words. Words, under his hands, have
unexpected growths; placid nouns and sober adjectives bear
fantastic fruit. Sometimes he packs his metaphors so close that
they become inextricably mixed. Sometimes he spins his fantasies
so thin that the cord of coherence snaps and the poem
frays into ragged and unpatterned ravellings. But, at his best,
Bodenheim is as clear-headed as he is colorful.</p>

<p class='c015'>In <cite>Advice</cite> (1920), Bodenheim’s manner—and his mannerisms—are
intensified. There is scarcely a phrase that is not
tricked out with more ornaments and associations than it can
bear; whole poems sink beneath the weight of their profuse
decorations. Yet, in spite of his verbal exaggerations, this
poetry achieves a keen if too ornate delicacy. In the realm of
the whimsical-grotesque, Bodenheim walks with a light and
nimble footstep.</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>Edwin Curran was born at Zanesville, Ohio, May 10, 1892,
and was educated at St. Thomas’ School in the city of his birth.
After working as an unskilled laborer in various trades, he
learned telegraphy in 1914 and has been employed ever since
as an operator for the Pennsylvania Railroad Company.</p>

<p class='c015'>In 1917 he printed a little paper-bound pamphlet of thirty
pages (<cite>First Poems</cite>) with this naïve note: “Price of this book
is 35 cents postpaid. Author is 25, unmarried, a beginner and
needs publisher. If this volume meets expenses, another, possibly
better, will be issued.” Expecting to find poetry of an
absurd simplicity, one is startled to find striking images,
strange pictures and (in such poems as “Soldier’s Epitaph”
and “Sailing of Columbus”) lines like:</p>

<p class='c015'><cite>Second Poems</cite> (1920) has a similar beauty mixed with banality.
Both booklets are a jumble of passion, platitude, bad

perceptions; he has little control over his music. For better or

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'><i>Edna St. Vincent Millay</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Edna St. Vincent Millay, possibly the most gifted of the
younger lyricists, was born February 22, 1892, at Rockland,
Maine. After a childhood spent almost entirely in New
England, she attended Vassar College, from which she was
graduated in 1917. Since that time she has lived in New York
City. Besides her keenly individual lyrics, Miss Millay has
written a quantity of short stories under various pseudonyms,
has translated several songs, and has been connected with the
Provincetown Players both as playwright and performer.</p>

<p class='c015'>Although the bulk of her poetry is not large, the quality of
it approaches and sometimes attains greatness. Her first long
poem, “Renascence,” was the outstanding feature of <cite>The Lyric
Year</cite> (1912), an anthology which revealed many new names.
“Renascence” was written when Miss Millay was scarcely
nineteen; it remains today one of the most remarkable poems
of this generation. Beginning like a child’s aimless verse it
proceeds, with a calm lucidity, to an amazing climax. It is as
if a child had, in the midst of its ingenuousness, uttered some
terrific truth. The sheer cumulative power of this poem is surpassed
only by its beauty.</p>

<p class='c015'><cite>Renascence</cite>, the name of Miss Millay’s first volume, was published
in 1917. It is full of the same passion as its title-poem;
here is a hunger for beauty so intense that no delight is great
enough to give the soul peace. Such poems as “God’s World”
and the unnamed sonnets vibrate with this rapture. Magic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>burns from the simplest of her lines. <cite>Figs from Thistles</cite>
(1920) is a far more sophisticated booklet. Sharp and cynically
brilliant, Miss Millay’s craftsmanship no less than her
intuition saves these poems from mere cleverness.</p>

<p class='c015'><cite>Second April</cite> (1921) is an intensification of her lyrical gift
tinctured with an increasing sadness and disillusion. Her
poignant poetic play, <cite>Aria da Capo</cite>, first performed by the
Provincetown Players in New York, was published in <cite>The
Monthly Chapbook</cite> (Harold Monro, England); the issue of
July, 1920, being devoted to it.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><i>Mary Carolyn Davies</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Mary Carolyn Davies was born at Sprague, Washington, and
was educated in the schools at and about Portland, Oregon.
At college (the University of California) she won the Emily
Chamberlin Cook prize for Poetry in 1912, being the first
freshman to win it. In the same year, she established another
precedent by being the first woman to win the Bohemian Club
prize. With the proceeds, the young poet went to New York,
arriving with the remnants of her fortune—four dollars and
eighty-five cents.</p>

<p class='c015'>The long struggle with the city began. Miss Davies wrote
short stories, two serials, reams of sentimental verses—anything
to keep alive. She turned finally to verse, chiefly because
“when the rent is due there’s no time to write a story, only
verse can save one in time.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Her work divides itself into two distinct classes: the hackwork
which she does for a living and the genuine poetry which
she creates for its own sake. Her first volume <cite>The Drums in
Our Street</cite> (1918) was a mixture of loud bombast and quiet
beauty, of blatant war-verse and unaffected lyrics. <cite>Youth
Riding</cite> (1919), although as uneven as its predecessor, is simpler
and surer. The poems in <i>vers libre</i> are clearly musical, and
her eight-line lyrics are particularly wistful and delicate.</p>

so appropriately named, has a frank tenderness that never

sing.</p>

<p class='c018'>Herbert S. Gorman was born at Springfield, Massachusetts,
January 1, 1893. After attending Technical High School he
became an actor for two seasons, deserting the stage for the
newspaper. He became assistant literary and dramatic editor of

<p class='c015'>His first book, <cite>The Fool of Love</cite> (1920), shows, above an

  <h2 class='c005'><i>Alter Brody</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Alter Brody was born at Kartúshkiya-Beróza, Province of
Grodno, Russia, November 1, 1895. He came to New York
City at the age of eight and, after a cursory schooling, wrote
translations for certain Jewish and American newspapers. His
first poems appeared in <cite>The Seven Arts</cite> in 1916-17.</p>

<p class='c015'>In <cite>A Family Album</cite> (1918) one sees the impress of a tense
and original mind, of imagination that is fed by strengthening
fact, of sight that is sharpened by insight. Many of Brody’s
lines are uncouth and awkward; what music he achieves is
mostly fortuitous, the melody accidental. And yet his pages
are filled with a picturesque honesty and uncompromising
beauty. Much of this work is an interpretation of the modern
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>world against a background of old dreams: young America
seen through the eyes of old Russia. It is a romantic realism
that uplifts such poems as “Kartúshkiya-Beróza” (a record of
boyhood which is one of Brody’s finest achievements though,
unfortunately, too long to quote), “A Row of Poplars: Central
Park,” “Ghetto Twilight” and the poignant “Lamentations.”
It is, to be more accurate, a romanticism that springs from
reality and, after a fantastic flight, settles back with a new
vision.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><i>Stephen Vincent Benét</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Stephen Vincent Benét, the younger brother of William Rose
Benét, was born at Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, in July, 1898.
He was educated in various parts of the country, graduating
from Yale in 1919.</p>

<p class='c015'>At seventeen he published a small book containing six
dramatic portraits, <cite>Five Men and Pompey</cite> (1915), a remarkable
set of monologues which, in spite of distinct traces of Browning
and Alfred Noyes, was little short of astounding, coming from
a schoolboy. In Benét’s next volume, <cite>Young Adventure</cite> (1918),
one hears something more than the speech of an infant prodigy;
the precocious facility has developed into a keen and individual
vigor.</p>

<p class='c015'><cite>Heavens and Earth</cite> (1920), the most representative collection,
has a greater imaginative sweep. Like his brother, the
younger Benét is at his best in the decoratively grotesque; his
fancy exults in running the scales between the whimsically
bizarre and the lightly diabolic.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'><i>Hilda Conkling</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Hilda Conkling, most gifted of recent infant prodigies, was
born at Catskill-on-Hudson, New York, October 8, 1910. The
daughter of Grace Hazard Conkling (see page <a href='#Page_207'>207</a>), she came
to Northampton, Massachusetts, with her mother when she was
three years old and has lived there since, a normal out-of-doors
little girl.</p>

<p class='c015'>Hilda began to write poems—or rather, to talk them—at the
age of four. Since that time, she has created one hundred and
fifty little verses, many of them astonishing in exactness of
phrase and beauty of vision. Hilda “tells” her poem and
her mother copies it down, arranges the line-divisions and
reads it to the child for correction. Conceding a possible half-conscious
shaping by Mrs. Conkling, the quality which shines
behind all of Hilda’s little facets of loveliness is a straightforward
ingenuousness, a childlike but sweeping fantasy.</p>

<p class='c015'><cite>Poems by a Little Girl</cite> (1920), published when Hilda was a
little more than nine years old, is a detailed proof of this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>delightful quality. Every poem bears its own stamp of unaffected
originality; “Water,” “Hay-Cock,” and a dozen others
are startling in their precision and a power of painting the
familiar in unsuspected colors. This child not only sees, feels
and hears with the concentration of a child-artist, she communicates
the results of her perceptions with the sensitivity of
a master-craftsman. She hears a chickadee talking</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c021'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The way smooth bright pebbles</div>
      <div class='line'>Drop into water.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Everything is extraordinarily vivid and fanciful to her keen
senses. The rooster’s comb is “gay as a parade;” he has
“pearl trinkets on his feet” and</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c021'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The short feathers smooth along his back</div>
      <div class='line'>Are the dark color of wet rocks,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or the rippled green of ships</div>
      <div class='line'>When I look at their sides through water.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>She observes:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c021'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The water came in with a wavy look</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Like a spider’s web.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>It is too early for judgments—even for a prophecy. It is
impossible to guess how much Hilda’s vision will be distorted
by knowledge and the traditions that will accompany her
growth. One can only hold one’s breath and hope for the
preservation of so remarkable a talent.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
